Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify.

Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline. How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility. For example, an app may require that you've received a certain amount of direct deposits into your bank account, a history of on-time cash advance payments, or a certain number of consecutive deposits.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319314":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319314","content":"<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</a></p><h3>Funding time</h3><p>Most cash advance apps have two options for funding: free and paid. The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee. Chime only charges $2 for instant delivery, and transfers within 24 hours are free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advances can be helpful if you're in a tight financial spot, they aren't meant to be something you continually rely on to cover your expenses, said Dr. Severine Bryan, founder of financial education and coaching company Sev Talks Money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319326","content":"<p>If you need to borrow money but don't want to use cash advance apps, you have several other options.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs.

Our senior editors are experts in the personal loan field.</li><li><strong>Determine criteria:</strong> Senior editors then determine which criteria to evaluate across lenders. Criteria include key loan terms, such as APRs, repayment periods, eligibility requirements, and loan types, plus loan features like whether cosigners are allowed and available discounts.</li><li><strong>Collect and verify data:</strong> Senior editors and editorial staff collect lender data from lender sites, lender representatives, and internal intake forms from Credible partners. Data is verified by a third party against its source to ensure that data is accurate, and the source is reliable and current.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Clean and score data</strong>: Once data collection and verification are complete, the data is cleaned and evaluated numerically. Scores are assigned for individual criteria based on how that lender compares in that category to its competitors. For example, a personal loan lender who offers repayment terms up to 10 years would compare favorably to a similar lender that only offers a 5-year repayment term.</li><li><strong>Assign weights:</strong> Once individual criteria are scored, they are each weighted by senior editors according to their importance for each user set. For example, a list of the best lenders for bad credit would heavily weight the minimum credit score that each lender requires, while a list of the best lenders for excellent credit would not.</li><li><strong>Determine star ratings:</strong> Once the scores for each set of criteria are weighted appropriately, each lender’s weighted scores are summed to arrive at an overall star rating, on a scale of 0 to 5.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Establish superlatives:</strong> Overall star ratings and individual criteria scores are evaluated across lenders to determine the best lenders by category, such as “best debt consolidation loans for fair credit.”</li></ol><p>Below are the weightings assigned to each general category for the best personal loan lenders — which is made up of individual criteria (that are individually weighted) in that category.</p>","leftCircleColor":null,"rightCircleColor":null},{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLowestRateSection","lowestRateSection":[{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLowesRateBox","title":"18.75% - Rates and fees","definition":"Definition: The APR range available from each lender","textContent":"We compared each lender’s annual percentage rate (APR) range, which accounts for the interest rate charged plus upfront fees, like origination fees.

The most common reason for denial is having what's called an “adverse credit history.” This doesn't necessarily mean you have a low credit score. It's about specific financial issues flagged during the credit review.</p><p>“You can have a low credit score and not have an adverse credit history. An adverse credit history means you've defaulted on debt or have debt in collections, or are subject to wage garnishments, tax liens, or other issues,” says Robert Farrington, founder of The College Investor.</p><p>According to Federal Student Aid, any of the following are considered adverse credit history:</p><ul><li>An outstanding balance of $2,085 or more that's delinquent for 90 or more days</li><li>Accounts in collections or charged off within the last two years</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/defaulting-on-student-loans\">Default</a> on debt within the last five years</li><li>Bankruptcy discharge within the last five years</li><li>Repossession or foreclosure within the last five years</li><li>Charge-off of federal student aid debt within the last five years</li><li>A wage garnishment or tax lien within the last five years</li></ul><p>You may also have your PLUS loan application denied simply because it wasn't possible to perform a credit check.</p><p>“One reason for denial that is not really a denial is if someone has a freeze or block on their credit report and forgot to take it off prior to applying,” says Jack Wang, college financial aid advisor at Innovative Advisory Group.</p><p>If your credit report has a security freeze, be sure to temporarily lift it so the credit check can proceed.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:204734":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"204734","content":"<h2>Steps to take if a parent PLUS loan is denied</h2><p>If your parent PLUS loan application is denied, you still have options to move forward. Depending on the circumstances, you can appeal the decision or add an endorser to the loan.</p><h3>Appeal the decision</h3><p>If the loan was denied because of incorrect information or unique circumstances, you can file an appeal. Federal Student Aid refers to this process as addressing “extenuating circumstances.” Examples include debt caused by identity theft or debts from a divorce that are no longer your responsibility.</p><p>To appeal, you'll need to provide documentation that explains your situation. For example, if the denial was related to identity theft, you might submit police reports or statements from your credit card issuer. Appeals can be <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/appeal-credit\">submitted online</a> or by calling 1-800-433-3243.</p><h3>Add an endorser</h3><p>Another way to secure a parent PLUS loan is to add an endorser, which works similarly to a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner</a>. An endorser agrees to share the responsibility for loan repayment if you're unable to make payments. However, there are restrictions: the endorser cannot be the student and must not have an adverse credit history.</p><p>To move forward, the endorser will need to complete the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/endorser-addendum/\">Endorser Addendum</a> form, which can be done online through the Federal Student Aid website.</p><h3>Request to increase your federal borrowing limit</h3><p>A parent PLUS loan denial may allow your child to qualify for higher federal student loan limits.</p><p>Typically, dependent students have lower borrowing limits compared with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/independent-vs-dependent-status\">independent students</a>. However, if your parent PLUS loan is denied, your child may be eligible for the same limits as an independent student.</p><p>An administrator in your school's financial aid office can tell you if this option is available and guide you through the next steps.</p><h2>Alternative options for financing college</h2><p>There are still other ways to finance your child's education, even if you ultimately can't get a parent PLUS loan.</p><p>Start by having your child submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/register-for-fafsa\">FAFSA</a>). This application determines eligibility for federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>, such as the Pell Grant, as well as work-study opportunities. Many schools and private organizations also use your FAFSA data to award <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> and other aid.</p><p>Private student loans can also help fill funding gaps. Unlike federal loans, which come from the Department of Education, private loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and other lenders. Some lenders even offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-parent-student-loans\">parent-specific loans</a>, which may work if you meet their credit requirements.</p><p>“Depending on the credit profile, parents may be able to use a private loan. Or some schools may even offer the income share agreement option for the student, which is to the student and generally <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/no-credit-check-student-loans\">does not require a credit check</a>,” says Wang.</p><p>If you're not eligible for a private loan, another family member with strong credit could act as a cosigner for your child's student loan.

Since your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, those on-time payments can help raise your credit score steadily over time. Additionally, it can show lenders that you're a responsible borrower and could make it easier for you to get credit in the future.</p><p>Set up automatic payments to avoid missing due dates. Some banks and online lenders also offer small APR discounts for setting up automatic payments.</p><h3>Credit utilization</h3><p>Your credit utilization ratio shows how much of your available credit you're using on revolving debt, such as credit cards. The ratio factors into your amounts owed, which makes up 30% of your credit score. While debt from personal loans doesn't factor into credit utilization, using a personal loan for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation</a> can have an indirect effect. The utilization ratio on any cards you pay off completely would drop to 0%, likely providing a boost to your credit score.</p><p>Credit utilization is measured both on individual accounts, such as each credit card, and as an aggregate of all your revolving debt. FICO recommends keeping your total credit utilization ratio below 10%.</p><h3>Credit mix</h3><p>Lenders generally like to see that you know how to handle several types of credit and loan accounts. As such, 10% of your credit score is based on your credit mix. If you don't have an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a>, such as a personal loan or auto loan, in your credit history, adding one might provide a slight boost to your credit score. Making timely monthly payments on the loan could help even more.</p><h2>How a personal loan can hurt your credit score</h2><ul><li><strong>Increases your debt:</strong> Taking on debt can bring down your score since, again, it would increase your total amount owed. This can affect your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>, which lenders also use to determine whether to lend to you. Your DTI is the amount you pay monthly toward your debt, divided by your pretax monthly income. In general, it's best to have a DTI below 35%.</li><li><strong>Adds a new credit inquiry:</strong> When you send in an application for a personal loan, it triggers a hard credit inquiry, which is added to your credit profile. While this will typically have only a <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">small impact on your credit</a>, the number of inquiries over the last 12 months is also counted. In general, you want this number to be as small as possible. Inquiries typically stay on your credit report for two years.</li></ul><p>“It's also critical to know you'll be able to make payments before taking out a personal loan. Your score can easily deteriorate if you find you can't make those payments on time or you begin to lag behind,” said Christian Simmons, a certified educator in personal finance. “A credit score can seem like an abstract or unimportant concept to some people, but having a good one can put you ahead in a number of financial situations — while having a poor one can significantly set you back.”</p><h2>What credit score is needed for a personal loan?</h2><p>Lenders generally want to see that you can meet certain requirements, such as a certain <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score</a>, to approve your application.</p><p>Lenders typically want to see a “good” FICO score of 670 or higher, though minimums among lenders vary.</p><p>Here's how FICO breaks down credit score ranges:</p><ul><li><strong>Under 580:</strong> Poor</li><li><strong>580 to 669:</strong> Fair</li><li><strong>670 to 739:</strong> Good</li><li><strong>740 to 799:</strong> Very Good</li><li><strong>800 or higher:</strong> Exceptional</li></ul><h2>How to get a personal loan</h2><p>Here are the steps to take out a personal loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Determine your loan needs:</strong> You'll first need to know exactly <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">how much you need to borrow</a> and how you plan to use it. You should also know the features you require from a lender, such as online payments and discount opportunities.</li><li><strong>Gather documentation:</strong> Typically, you'll need to provide documentation such as pay stubs or bank statements, as well as proof of residence (like a utility bill) and a form of ID. Having those ready will streamline the application process.</li><li><strong>Shop around:</strong> You can start <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">comparing lenders</a> that meet your criteria. Consider factors such as loan amounts, time to fund, and repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Get prequalified:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> checks to see if you're likely to qualify with a given lender, and if so, what your terms might look like — without hurting your credit. You should keep in mind, however, that prequalification does not show the exact rates or terms you'd receive if you formally applied for the loan. So there's some room for error, though it's still a helpful tool.</li><li><strong>Pick a lender:</strong> Consider the potential costs associated with each lender, such as the <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which includes the interest rate and fees. But you should also check if the lender provides any of those extra features you pinpointed in your wish list. A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">loan calculator</a> can come in handy here, since it can compare the potential costs associated with each lender.</li><li><strong>Send in your application:</strong> Follow the instructions supplied by the lender, including supplying any additional materials it may request. At this point, the lender will conduct a hard credit inquiry, which can lower your score slightly for about a year. The amount of time it will take to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete the application</a> and get approved depends on the lender. Some lenders can <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">fund your loan</a> as soon as the same or next business day.</li><li><strong>Sign for the loan:</strong> Once approved, you can sign your loan documents, get your funds, and start making payments.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How To Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>How to improve your credit score after getting a personal loan</h2><p>Once you've received your loan, your work as a responsible credit user isn't done. Here are a few strategies that could help boost your credit score:</p><ul><li><strong>Repay your loan on time:</strong> Though a single on-time payment likely won't improve your credit score, making consistent on-time payments could make a big difference. Remember, payment history is the single largest factor in your FICO score, accounting for 35%.</li><li><strong>Consolidate debt, but don't eliminate cards: </strong>If you're using a debt consolidation loan to pay off credit cards, keep the cards open. The length of your credit history, which includes how long individual accounts have been open, accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Even though you may have resolved never to run up balances on those cards again, closing them would reduce the average age of your credit accounts.</li><li><strong>Wait before applying for new credit:</strong> Credit applications typically involve a hard credit inquiry that could lower your credit score by up to five points for as long as one year — and stay on your credit report for two years. So if the loan you just received triggered a hard credit check, your credit score may already be feeling the effects. Even a small, temporary dip in your credit score can chip away at any improvements you make.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye on your credit: </strong>Keeping tabs on your credit score can help you catch errors or unauthorized accounts that pop up. You can check your credit report for free with <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> or find out if your bank provides free credit monitoring.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227070":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227070","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\"><i>What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\"><i>What Are Personal Loans Used For?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\"><i>Secured vs. Unsecured Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan\"><i>Best Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Fair Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-good-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Good Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Excellent Credit</i></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:226242":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"226242","content":"<p>Paying a personal loan off early could mean less money spent on interest.

Consider this example:</p><p>According to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Credible loan rates data</a>, the average interest rate on a 5-year loan for someone with a 700 FICO score was around 24% in October 2023. For a <a href=\"/personal-loan/10k-loan\">$10,000 loan</a>, based on that rate, you’d pay $7,261 in interest over the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">loan’s term</a>. However, if instead of paying for the whole five years, you paid the loan off after two, you’d save $3,024.</p><p>If you paid it off after three years, or two years early, you’d save $1,463.</p><p>The higher the rate is on your loan, the more you can save by paying it off early.</p><h2>Prepayment penalty on a personal loan</h2><p>A prepayment penalty is a fee a financial institution may impose if you pay off your personal loan early. The bank’s rationale is that you’re depriving it of income in the form of interest payments, so it reserves the right to penalize you to offset that loss. Fortunately, this practice isn’t common, and none of the <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan lenders</a> we review charge borrowers for getting out of debt too quickly.</p><p>However, you should review the fine print of any loan you already have or plan to get to see if it includes a prepayment penalty. If it does, you could see the fee in one of three ways, said Howard Dvorkin, chairman of Debt.com.</p><p>“First, [the lender] can charge you a percentage of your loan balance. That's usually around 2%,” he said. “Second, they can charge you a flat fee. Or third — and worst of all — they can actually charge you all the interest you're saving by paying early.”</p><h2>How to pay off a personal loan early</h2><p>You could pay your personal loan off early if you experience a windfall or otherwise have a large lump sum sitting in the bank. However, Dvorkin said, “You don't have to think so big. You can also pay off your loan early by nibbling away at it every month.”</p><p>Here are some strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Add extra funds to each payment:</strong> Even $10-$20 more per month can reduce your principal balance faster.</li><li><strong>Make payments biweekly:</strong> When you make payments every two weeks, you’ll submit an extra month’s worth by year-end.</li><li><strong>Make additional payments annually or when possible:</strong> For example, use some or all of a work bonus or monetary gift to pay down your debt.</li><li><strong>Increase your income:</strong> Then, put extra money toward your personal loan.</li></ul><h2>Refinance your personal loan</h2><p>When you refinance your personal loan, you take out a new loan to <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/pay-off-debt\">pay off your existing debt</a>. Generally, it may make sense to refinance if <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rates</a> have dropped, or you’d qualify for a lower interest rate because your credit score has increased since you initially borrowed.</p><p>You can refinance a personal loan with another personal loan, or you could use another debt instrument, like a 0% APR credit card balance transfer. In the former scenario, watch out for <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> — even if the interest rate is lower than what you currently pay, an origination fee could make the transaction more expensive. Instead of comparing interest rates, look at the loan’s annual percentage rate (APR) to get a truer measure of cost.</p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR credit card</a> could make sense if you pay off the balance transferred within the promotional period. If not, you could end up paying a higher interest rate than you would have originally. Note that balance transfers usually cost 3% to 5% of the amount transferred, which is added to your credit card balance.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loans/borrower\">Compare Rates Now</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324562":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324562","content":"<h2>Our take on Reprise</h2><p>Reprise Financial (4.2 out of 5 stars) is the highest-rated Credible lending partner that considers bad-credit borrowers, and the main reason is its comparatively low interest rates.

Because collateral that minimizes the lender’s risk, you could also qualify for a lower interest rate.</li><li><strong>Joint applications accepted:</strong>&nbsp;Another way to improve your approval odds, lower your rate, or qualify for a larger loan amount is to apply with a joint applicant, such as a spouse or family member — especially if the co-applicant has a better credit score or higher income.</li><li><strong>Fast funding:</strong>&nbsp;Upgrade can fund your loan by the next business day.

That includes affiliated credit cards, such as store cards for Macy’s, Home Depot, and Wayfair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-cant-you-use-a-personal-loan-for\">What Can't You Use a Personal Loan For?</a></p><h2>Citibank personal loan fees and penalties</h2><h3>Loan origination fees</h3><p>Citibank doesn’t charge an origination fee for personal loans. Many personal loan lenders deduct an origination fee from the initial loan proceeds to cover the cost of processing your application and issuing the loan. Citibank is one of several lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">personal loans with no origination fee</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Early repayment penalties</h3><p>Most personal loan lenders don’t charge prepayment penalties, including Citibank. You can save money on interest by paying extra each month or <a href=\"/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">repaying your loan balance at any time</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Other fees</h3><p>Citibank doesn’t charge hidden fees or incidental fees like late payment fees. However, the bank still penalizes you for defaulting on your payments by increasing your APR by 2.00%. Paying a few days late isn’t likely to trigger the penalty APR, but check your loan terms for what constitutes default. Bear in mind that late payments may also damage your credit score.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Citibank compares to other lenders</h2><p>Some of Citibank’s competitors offer lower starting APRs, larger loan amounts, and longer repayment terms. The chart below shows how Citibank compares to two similar online banks, which both offer personal loans with fast funding and no upfront fees.

The result is your discretionary income for federal student loans.&nbsp;</p><h2>Which repayment plans use discretionary income?</h2><p>There are currently four income-driven repayment plans that use the discretionary income calculation for student loan borrowers:</p><ul><li>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-contingent-repayment\">Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)</a></li><li>Pay As You Earn plans (PAYE)</li></ul><p>Starting in July 2026, though, these programs will no longer be available to new borrowers, and most will begin to be phased out for existing borrowers. A new income-driven plan, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/repayment-assistance-plan\">Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)</a>, will be the only income-driven option for new borrowers, and IBR is the only legacy income-driven plan not being phased out for those already in it before July 1, 2028.</p><p>However, RAP will not use the discretionary income calculation.</p><p>“RAP calculates payments based on AGI and the number of dependents,” says MacPhetres. “There is no poverty line protection amount.”&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:323662":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"323662","content":"<h2>How discretionary income affects monthly payments</h2><p>Discretionary income has a direct impact on how much you pay under certain student loan repayment plans. For example, with the PAYE Plan, you’d pay 10% of your discretionary income. If your discretionary income was $50,000, for example, you could expect to pay $5,000 annually in student loan payments — or about $417 per month.</p><p>Here’s a look at how payment percentages vary by plan type:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:323666":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"323666","content":"<p>While the new RAP income-driven plan won’t calculate payments this way, it “may result in higher monthly payments for some borrowers compared with SAVE or IBR, because RAP doesn’t exclude 150% or 225% of the poverty guideline from income,” says MacPhetres.</p><h2>Discretionary income vs disposable income</h2><p>You might have heard the term “disposable income” before, and while it sounds similar to discretionary income, the two aren’t the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike discretionary income, disposable income doesn’t factor into federal student loan calculations. It’s also typically used as a more general budgeting term.</p><p>“Disposable income is generally after any after-tax deductions that the person may have, such as a direct deposit into savings, child support, or wage garnishment,” says Wang. “It’s usually also after any loan, mortgage, or rent payments, too.”</p><p>Disposable income also doesn’t factor in any localized elements (such as the state poverty level, as discretionary income does).&nbsp;</p><p>“It does not take into account the difference in cost of living based on geography,” says Wang. “It is the same measure for the contiguous 48 states. Only Alaska and Hawaii are treated differently.”</p><h2>How to lower your discretionary income</h2><p>Since your discretionary income factors into your monthly student loan payments on certain repayment plans, the less discretionary income you have, the less you’ll have to pay toward your student loans each month. And while no one wants to take a pay cut just to have lower student loan payments, there are strategies you can employ if you want to pay less.&nbsp;</p><p>“Discretionary income is based on two factors — adjusted gross income and family size,” explains Wang. “Anything that a person can do to lower AGI can help.”</p><p>This might include:</p><ul><li>Increasing your retirement contributions</li><li>Taking additional tax deductions</li><li>Putting more into a health savings account</li><li>Making catch-up retirement contributions if you’re over age 50</li></ul><p>And if you do end up taking a pay cut, make sure to recertify your income as soon as possible.</p><p>“Generally, a borrower would update their AGI — and therefore, their discretionary income — each year,” says Wang. “However, a borrower can update more frequently if there is a job change or job loss, or if the borrower or spouse is pregnant. Even though the baby may not yet be born, that counts as an increase in family size.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:16070":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"16070","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:321354":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"321354","content":"<p>ELFI has been helping borrowers refinance student loans since 2015.

Lenders typically reserve their lowest rates for borrowers with strong credit. On the FICO scale, a good score starts at 670, very good at 740, and exceptional at 800 or higher. If your score is lower, some lenders allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/refinance-with-cosigner\">apply with a cosigner</a>.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI): </strong>This measures how much of your monthly income goes toward debt payments. Most lenders prefer a DTI of 35% or less, since it shows you have room in your budget for another loan. If your DTI is higher, paying down existing debt or increasing your income may improve your chances.</li><li><strong>Income stability: </strong>Lenders want to see reliable income, and some set minimum income requirements.

Doctoral degree recipients graduate with an average of $92,926 in federal student loan debt, and those with professional degrees graduate with $153,335 in federal loans, according to an analysis by The Institute for College Access &amp; Success.</p><p>The best way to pay for this higher education is through scholarships and grants, followed by federal student loans. But these often aren't enough to complete a PhD program, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> can help you foot the rest of the bill. Ascent stands out as a top lender for doctoral student loans with features such as extended grace periods and no-cosigner loans.</p><h2>How to get a PhD loan</h2><p>Follow these five steps to help ensure you get the best student loans for your individual situation:</p><p><strong>1. Start with the FAFSA:</strong> Fill out the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> to make yourself eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">work-study</a>, and student loans from the federal government. Many of these forms of financial aid don't require you to repay them, so you'll want to make sure you receive as much as you can qualify for. You may also choose to borrow certain federal student loans to take advantage of the more flexible repayment plans they offer.</p><p><strong>2. Determine how much more money you need for your education:</strong> Your university's financial aid office will help you determine how much you'll need to borrow in student loans to meet your cost of attendance, taking into account any federal financial aid you receive.</p><p><strong>3. Prequalify for a private student loan:</strong> Most <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student lenders</a> make it easy to prequalify for a graduate student loan. You can do this online by submitting some basic information about yourself, such as your annual income, the school you're attending, and how much you'd like to borrow. It's a good idea to prequalify with several different lenders to see the rates and terms you might qualify for.</p><p><strong>4. Choose your loan:</strong> Review your prequalification offers, comparing loan terms, interest rates, and monthly payment amounts. Select the lender and loan option that works best for you, then submit a formal application.</p><p><strong>5. Make sure your loan funds are received:</strong> Student lenders typically disburse your loan funds directly to your university. You'll want to double-check with your school's financial aid office that the money was received.</p><h2>Best PhD loans and funding options for doctoral students</h2>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15774":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15774","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rate-table","variation":"shortened"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:318094":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"318094","content":"<h2>Are PhD loans different from other graduate loans?</h2><p>PhD loans are a type of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/graduate-student-loans\">graduate loan</a>.

Its report notes that these amounts don’t include housing, food, books, supplies, transportation, or other expenses that can significantly increase the overall cost of completing a PhD, which typically takes about seven years of graduate study.<br><br>However, data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) shows that a majority of doctoral students in science and engineering receive some form of institutional support, such as tuition waivers, stipends, fellowships, or teaching and research assistantships. This can sometimes cover tuition in full and provide an income to help with living costs. As a result, many PhD students pay far less out of pocket for their education.</p><h2>When does it make sense to take out a PhD loan?</h2><p>Taking out a PhD loan may be the right move for you if scholarships, grants, and work-study don't cover the cost of your education. It's best to apply for federal student loans first due to their borrower benefits. If you max out your federal student loan eligibility, you may consider private student loans to bridge the gap.</p><p>Keep your future earning potential in mind before taking out a PhD loan. A good rule of thumb is to borrow no more than your expected first-year salary after you complete your degree.</p><h2>PhD loan limits</h2><p>Each student loan type has a limit, and some are higher than others:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loans: </strong>You can borrow up to $20,500 each year, with an aggregate limit of $138,500. This amount includes any undergraduate loans, and only $65,500 can be in subsidized loans.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans: </strong>You can borrow up to your school's total cost of attendance. There aren't any annual limits.</li><li><strong>Private grad school loans:</strong> Loan limits vary by lender, and private student loans typically have minimum loan amounts in addition to loan maximums. For example, you must borrow at least $1,000 with College Ave, but you can borrow as much as your school-certified cost of attendance.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:318110":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"318110","content":"<p><strong>Further Reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/graduate-student-loans/graduate-loan-limits\">Graduate Student Loan Limits: How Much Can I Borrow?</a></p><h2>When PhD student loan payments start</h2><p>With student loans, you generally have the option of beginning to pay them back right away or waiting until you leave school. The rules vary depending on the type of loan you take out:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loans:</strong> You're not required to begin repaying these loans until 6 months after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment. But you are responsible for the interest that accrues from the moment the loan is disbursed. If you don't pay the interest while you're in school, it'll be <a href=\"/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">added to the principal of the loan</a> once you graduate. You may choose to make interest-only payments while in school to keep this from building up and adding to the total you have to repay.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans:</strong> Like Direct Unsubsidized Loans, you have a 6-month grace period after leaving school before you're required to begin paying back your loan. You're responsible for the interest from the time the money is disbursed, and you may make interest-only payments while in school.</li><li><strong>Private PhD loans:</strong> Different lenders may have slightly varying rules, but you generally don't need to make loan payments while enrolled in school or during a 6- to 9-month grace period after graduating. You're generally responsible for the interest that accrues from the time the loan is disbursed. You typically have the option to make interest-only payments or full principal and interest payments or to defer payments entirely. However, this last option will mean the interest that accrues while you're enrolled in school will be added to the total you'll need to pay back.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:318114":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"318114","content":"<h2>Student loan forgiveness for PhD loans</h2><p>If you have federal student loans, you may be eligible for certain loan forgiveness programs covering the amount you borrowed for your PhD program.</p><p>One of the most common ways to do this is through the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program</a>. To be eligible, you must make 120 qualifying loan payments under an income-driven repayment plan while working full-time for a government or not-for-profit agency. Only Direct Loans qualify for PSLF.</p><p>Private loans aren't eligible for any type of loan forgiveness.</p><p>If you're having trouble managing your PhD student loan debt, refinancing is one option that might help. It can result in a lower interest rate and a lower monthly payment, particularly if student loan interest rates have dropped since you took out your loans. Your credit score also plays a crucial role in determining the interest rate you'll be offered. If yours isn't that strong, a cosigner with a better credit score or higher income than you could help. About one-third of borrowers who refinanced their student loans in 2024 did so with a cosigner, according to Credible marketplace data.</p><h2>PhD loan alternatives</h2><p>You should generally use student loans as a last resort when paying for your higher education. You may be able to help pay for the cost of tuition and living expenses with a few of these options, reducing the amount you need to borrow:</p><ul><li><strong>Scholarships and grants:</strong> Both scholarships and grants are considered gift aid — meaning you don't need to pay them back. You may be able to earn a scholarship or grant from your university or nonprofit organizations. Each scholarship or grant program has its own criteria. Your school's financial aid office may be able to help you determine which programs you can qualify for.</li><li><strong>Fellowships and assistantships:</strong> Many universities employ PhD students as teaching or research assistants for professors, typically in the same department. You may also qualify for a fellowship — a competitive short-term research opportunity with financial support.</li><li><strong>Employer assistance:</strong> Depending on where you work, your current employer may be willing to help you pay for your higher education if your field of study is related to your career. Your company's human resources department can determine if you qualify for employer assistance programs.</li></ul><h2>Why you can trust us</h2><p>The Credible editorial team is independent and unbiased.

Home equity loan</h3><p><strong>Best if you have sufficient equity and are ok using your home as collateral</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> allows you to borrow against a portion of the equity you’ve built in your home. For example, if your home appraises for $400,000 and you owe $200,000, you would have $200,000 in equity. However, most lenders only let you borrow up to around 80% of your home’s appraised value, less than the amount you owe on your mortgage.</p><p>So, in this case, you’d subtract your outstanding mortgage balance of $200,000 from $320,000 (80% of $400,000) to get the amount you could potentially borrow: $120,000. Upon approval, the lender would send you a lump sum that you would repay, plus interest, through fixed payments over a period of years.

However, instead of getting a lump sum loan upfront, you’re given access to a credit line for a draw period — often up to 10 years. When the draw period ends, you enter the repayment period. Lenders may require a balloon payment or allow monthly payments over a set term.&nbsp;</p><p>With HELOCs, you can withdraw funds as needed and will only pay interest on what you borrow.

Cash-out refi</h3><p><strong>Best for a single monthly payment&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a> involves replacing your current mortgage with a larger one. After you pay off your original mortgage, you can use the remaining funds for your bathroom remodel or other expenses.</p><p>Cash-out refi loans can be a good fit if you want to tap into your home equity but prefer one monthly mortgage payment over two. They also make sense if you can get one with an interest rate that's lower than the current rate on your mortgage. This might be the case if you've improved your credit or if interest rates have come down since you first got your mortgage.</p><p>Lenders typically charge closing costs, which range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount, and the closing process can take a month or longer.</p><h3>5. Credit card</h3><p><strong>Best for potential rewards and 0% APR promotions</strong></p><p>If you have a card with available credit, you could use it to pay for bathroom remodel expenses. However, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">credit cards</a> are best used for short-term financing that you can pay off within the card's grace period (usually one billing cycle) or within a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR promotional period</a> (up to 21 months or more, depending on the card).&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Citi Custom Cash Card is a no-annual-fee rewards card with a 0% intro APR on purchases for 15 months. It also offers 5% cash back on up to $500 per billing cycle in your top eligible spending category, which can include home improvement stores, and 1% cash back on all other purchases thereafter.</p><p>Using credit cards for long-term financing is inadvisable because they tend to have higher interest rates than the other credit products on this list. For instance, the average APR for credit cards is 21.39%, compared to 11.14% for a two-year personal loan, according to the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>It can also be difficult to get approved for a credit line large enough to cover a full bathroom remodel or a 0% APR card. You're most likely to qualify if you have an excellent credit score (a FICO score of 800 or higher) and financial profile.</p><h3>6. FHA 203(k) home improvement loan</h3><p><strong>Best for homeowners with FHA-approved lenders</strong></p><p>The FHA 203(k) home improvement loan program was designed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It allows you to finance up to $75,000 or more into your mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade your home.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use it when buying a new home or refinancing your existing one. However, among other requirements, you must plan to make at least $5,000 in eligible repairs or improvements to qualify.

Bathroom remodel costs vary due to a variety of factors, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Location:</strong> Where you live impacts your remodel costs due to variations in labor costs, material prices, and compliance fees (e.g., required permits and inspections).</li><li><strong>Project scope:</strong>&nbsp;Minor remodels are more superficial and affordable, while major updates are more comprehensive and pricey. Partial remodels fall in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Contractor selection:</strong>&nbsp;The type of contractor you hire will significantly impact your costs. The higher the skill level and service tier, the more you’ll pay.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bathroom size:</strong>&nbsp;The square footage of the bathroom can impact the cost, as it can mean more updates, materials, and labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> The features you want to add will play a major role in your costs, such as a bathtub, shower, cabinets, countertops, new faucets, or a toilet. The more you want to change or add, the higher the cost.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> The quality of your chosen materials also plays a role. You can opt for economy, midrange, or upscale.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Damages:</strong> If you have damages that need to be repaired, such as water damage from leaks, those can significantly add to your costs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Demolition and preparation:</strong> Demolition services expand your project scope. You may also need to pay for junk and debris removal.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Plumbing and electrical changes:</strong> If changes to your plumbing or electrical systems are required, they can result in much higher costs.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“The ‘hidden’ costs of remodeling a bathroom come in if you decide to relocate the major items like the shower, sink, or toilet. Once you start to involve the plumbing and framing of the bathroom, the costs will go up significantly,” says Paul Dashevsky, real estate investor and co-CEO of GreatBuildz.</p><h2>Return on investment (ROI) and resale value</h2><p>When deciding how much to spend, consider the expected return on investment. “The cost of a midrange bath remodel will typically have a return of around 67.2%, while an upscale bath remodel recoups about 60.2%. In that context, upgrading your fixtures, lighting, and storage should be less expensive and more appealing to buyers,” says Alexei Morgado, Realtor in Florida and founder of Lexawise Real Estate Exam Preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>Morgado also stresses the importance of understanding average standards for bathroom remodels in your neighborhood. “When you over-improve your remodel in terms of quality and features, you may not receive much of a return on your investment when you try to sell it,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Thomsen, real estate broker at MODUS Real Estate Denver, adds that the general rule of thumb is to keep your bathroom remodel within 5% to 10% of your home’s value if resale is the goal. “That said, not every upgrade is about ROI. If you're planning to stay in the home for many years, you can justify spending more for personal comfort, especially in areas like walk-in showers, heated floors, or upgraded lighting,” Thomsen says. Just don’t expect to get your money back on those extra upgrades when you sell.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:315642":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"315642","content":"<h2>Tips on comparing bathroom remodel loans</h2><p>With a range of bathroom remodel loans on the market, shopping around helps to ensure you get a competitive deal. However, it can be overwhelming. As you compare quotes, here are the key factors to note:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Look for a loan amount that suits your needs. It needs to be enough to cover your estimated remodel costs. Plus, a bit of a buffer can be helpful for unexpected expenses.</li><li><strong>APR:</strong> The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> indicates the annualized cost of a loan, including interest and upfront lender fees. The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to publish APRs, which makes it easier to compare costs apples to apples.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Loans often have fees. Note any fees and how you’ll be required to pay them (e.g., upfront, deducted from the loan, rolled into the loan).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan terms:</strong> Lenders offer different&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> and, typically, increase the APR on longer terms. Longer terms often mean lower monthly payments but higher overall costs and interest. Look for a lender with a loan term that suits your needs and budget.</li><li><strong>Monthly payment amounts:</strong> Make sure the monthly payment amount fits your budget.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Overall costs:</strong> Calculate the overall cost of any loan you’re considering. Lower is generally better, as long as you can afford the monthly payment. Some borrowers may be better served by a lower monthly payment with a higher overall cost.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Collateral:</strong>&nbsp;Consider if a lender requires you to pledge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/collateral-loans\">collateral</a> to get the loan. Collateral can help you get a lower interest rate, but it will be at risk if you default.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Consider how easy it is to get a loan from the lender. Can you prequalify without hurting your credit? How long does it typically take to get approved and receive the funds? And what are your options for making loan payments and getting in touch with customer support?</li><li><strong>Reviews:</strong> See how the lender fares in online reviews from past customers on third-party sites like Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As you review lenders, it can help to make a chart that compares them side by side.

Check your credit</h3><p>Eligibility for any loan depends on your credit scores and reports. Before applying, ensure you don’t have erroneous information hurting your reports, and consider taking steps that can quickly improve your scores. For example, paying down credit card balances and adding current bills to a service like Experian Boost can help.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Figure out the amount you want to borrow</h3><p>Next, figure out how much you need to borrow. This step involves creating a detailed plan for your bathroom remodel. You’ll need to identify each update you want to make and how much it’ll cost, including demolition, cleanup, materials, and labor. Then, tally up the total amount you need for the project. You may also want to include a 10% buffer for unexpected costs.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Find a lender</h3><p>With a large pool of lenders in the market, finding the best fit requires shopping around, collecting quotes, and comparing the offerings. First, determine which type of loan you want to get. If you’re seeking a personal loan for home improvement, Credible lets you prequalify with 19 lenders through one prequalification form.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Get the loan</h3><p>Once you identify the winning quote and want to move forward, select it and fill out the full application. The application process often involves allowing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a> and providing proof of income, employment, and identity.

You can then use them to fund the remodel.</p><h2>Methodology&nbsp;</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best loans for bathroom remodel financing.

Some federal loans are awarded based on financial need, while others are available to all students regardless of income.</p><p>Private student loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Most private loans have credit and income requirements, either directly or through a cosigner, and may be harder to qualify for than federal loans.</p><p>“Federal student loans are low-income borrowers’ best funding option because eligibility is not tied to credit history, they come with fixed interest rates, and they unlock access to essential safety nets, such as income-driven repayment and deferment options,” says Bethany Hubert, college lending and financial aid specialist at Earnest.</p><h2>Federal aid for low-income borrowers</h2><p>While some types of federal aid are open to all students, there are certain options specifically designed to help low-income students. Here are some specific types of federal aid designed for students with limited means.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\"><strong>Direct Subsidized Loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;These loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. They don't accrue interest while you’re in school, so you graduate with a lower loan balance than you would with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">unsubsidized loan</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/pell-grant-calculator-and-eligibility\"><strong>Pell Grants</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The federal government awards these grants to undergraduate students who have exceptional financial need. These grants don’t have to be repaid, and you can receive one for each year that you’re in school (up to six years).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\"><strong>Federal Work Study</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Both undergraduate and graduate students with financial need may qualify for work study, which provides part-time employment to help them earn extra money for school. Work study income doesn’t have to be repaid, but does have to be earned through employment.</li><li><strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG):</strong>&nbsp;This program offers grants to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Grants are administered by the financial aid offices at each participating school.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\"><strong>Income-driven repayment</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Once you graduate, you can sign up for an income-driven repayment plan, which adjusts your monthly loan payments based on your income. Your payments will be limited to a certain percentage of your discretionary income. Very low-income borrowers could pay as little as $0 per month.</li></ul><h2>Private student loans for low-income students</h2><p>Low-income students may also want to turn to private student loans if federal loans don't go far enough.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some students might still have a gap after exhausting their annual borrowing limit for federal loans,” says Angela Colatriano, chief operating officer of College Ave. “For example, a student can typically borrow up to $5,500 in federal loans in their freshman year. For students who still have a gap to cover after exhausting federal aid and other need or merit-based grants and scholarships,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> can help cover the remaining cost.”</p><p>Private lenders generally require a sufficient and stable income to qualify for loans. They also require a credit check to ensure you’re a responsible borrower. Unfortunately, many low-income students won’t meet these requirements on their own, especially fresh out of high school. However, you can apply with a cosigner who meets the income and credit requirements.</p><p>While private loans can be an excellent supplement to federal loans, it’s also important to minimize your borrowing so you don’t overburden yourself after graduation. Colatriano recommends analyzing your financial situation to understand how much you feel comfortable borrowing.&nbsp;</p><p>“For students planning to borrow, be sure to understand what repayment will look like after graduation,” says Colatriano. “A helpful guideline is to borrow less in total than what you expect to earn in your first year after graduation. By doing so, you can typically be on track to pay off your loans in around 10 years.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15718":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15718","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:315302":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"315302","content":"<h2>How to qualify for financial aid as a low-income student</h2><p>The first step to qualifying for any federal financial aid is to complete the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-does-fafsa-work\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>.

The NCUA board voted to raise this rate to 18%, which is the current cap — it's set to expire in March 2026.</p><p>Credit unions may also have less stringent eligibility requirements for personal loans than banks.

For example, Discover requires a minimum individual or household income of $25,000 per year to qualify for a personal loan.</li><li><strong>Citizenship status</strong>: Banks often require you to be a United States citizen or permanent resident to qualify for funding. Some banks offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/loans-for-non-us-citizens\">loans for non-citizens</a> who are permanent residents, although they may have to meet additional eligibility requirements.</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: Lenders can decline to lend money to people who are too young to enter into a legal contract.

You could potentially eliminate your debt completely by declaring bankruptcy, you could negotiate directly or indirectly with creditors to pay back a reduced amount, or you could be eligible for reduced fees and/or interest rates through a debt management program.</p><p><strong>In general, it makes sense to consider debt relief in the following situations:</strong></p><ol><li>You have significant consumer debt that you're struggling to pay back.</li><li>You’ve already cut your expenses and don’t have any extras to eliminate from your budget.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/blog/personal-finance/6-ways-get-paid-youre-worth/\">You aren’t able to boost your income</a>.</li><li>You have no realistic expectation of being able to pay off your debt within five years.</li></ol><p>If you’ve come up with a detailed budget, done everything you can to save money, and tried to increase your earnings and still can’t make ends meet — debt relief may be the best option for you. When it comes to debt relief programs, there are three different ways to tackle your balances.</p><h2>1. Debt management plans</h2><p>If you have too much debt or are unable to repay your debt, a <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/how-get-out-debt\">credit counseling agency</a> may recommend that you pursue a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan (DMP)</a>. With this approach, a certified credit counselor reviews your finances and develops the DMP. Each month, you send payments to the credit counseling agency, and they use them to pay your creditors on an agreed-upon schedule.</p><p>As part of the DMP, the agency may negotiate with creditors to waive certain fees or lower your interest rates. A DMP requires you to make regular, on-time payments, and you may make payments for several years. As part of the DMP, you may have to agree to close your accounts and not apply for new ones.</p><h2>2. Debt settlement programs</h2><p>With debt settlement, a company works on your behalf to convince your creditors to accept a reduced settlement instead of the full balance you owe. For example, according to Accredited Debt Relief clients pay 68% to 75% of enrolled debt upon successful completion of the program. If you had $30,000 in consumer debt, that means you’d repay just $20,400 to $22,500.</p><p>That may sound amazing, but the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-debt-relief-program-and-how-do-i-know-if-i-should-use-one-en-1457/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> warns that debt settlement can be risky.</p><p>While the settlement process is underway, the debt settlement company will typically tell you to stop making payments to your creditors. During this time, late fees, penalty charges, and interest will continue to accrue, and your credit score can be severely damaged. You could even end up in more debt than you started with.</p><p>Debt settlement companies typically charge high fees for their services. For example, the fee for National Debt Relief is 18% to 25% of your enrolled debt. And, the program can take up to four years to complete — if negotiations are successful. It's possible the debt relief company might not reach a successful negotiation. But they can only legally charge you if they have successfully negotiated your debt.</p><p>If a company can successfully settle your debt, the debt settlement savings may make those fees and drawbacks worth it, but you should carefully consider your options before pursuing it.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Bankruptcy</h2><p>If you’ve exhausted your other options, declaring bankruptcy may make sense, but it has lasting consequences.</p><p>When you declare bankruptcy, the court will review your situation. If it agrees that you’re unable to repay your debt, it will issue a court order discharging the debt (Chapter 7) or you'll be subject to a repayment plan for three to five years (Chapter 13) — after successfully completing it, your debt will be discharged. That typically means you’ll no longer owe money on your credit cards, medical bills, or personal loans.</p><h3>The automatic stay</h3><p>One of the immediate benefits of filing either type of bankruptcy is the automatic stay. Your creditors are required to stop all collection efforts. You won’t receive any more harassing phone calls or letters in the mail, and bill collectors can’t garnish your wages.</p><p>However, bankruptcy has serious consequences. Bankruptcy information can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years and can make it difficult to get credit, buy a home, or even qualify for life insurance. Plus, the bankruptcy process can be expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide to pursue bankruptcy, you must get credit counseling from a government-approved organization within six months before you file. You can find a list of eligible programs on the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ust\">U.S. Trustee Program website</a>.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-bankruptcy\">Debt Consolidation vs. Bankruptcy: How To Choose</a></p><h2>3 times you shouldn’t pursue debt relief</h2><p>If you lost your job or went through a medical emergency, debt relief can be incredibly helpful and give you the breathing room you need to get back on your feet. However, it’s not appropriate for everyone. Here are three situations where debt relief doesn’t make sense.</p><h3>1. You haven’t reached out to creditors yet</h3><p>If you can’t afford your payments, reach out to your creditors right away — this should be your first step. Student loan servicers, personal loan lenders, and even credit card companies sometimes have hardship programs, where you can make reduced payments or qualify for a lower interest rate.</p><p>Contact your creditors directly and explain your situation, saying what you can afford to pay and what kind of help you need. You may qualify for temporary programs that don’t cost you anything.</p><h3>2. You can repay your debt within five years</h3><p>If you can pay off your debt within five years by cutting expenses or working a side hustle, debt relief may not be necessary for you. You can work with a nonprofit credit counseling agency to develop a budget and get personalized advice to tackle your debt so you can pay off your balances without paying extra fees or damaging your credit.</p><p>To find a reputable credit counseling agency, check with your <a href=\"https://www.naag.org/\">state Attorney General</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer\">local consumer protection agency</a>.</p><h3>3. You’re eligible for debt consolidation</h3><p>If you’re dealing with debt, but still have good enough credit, you may be able to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">tackle your balances with debt consolidation</a>. With this approach, you take out a personal loan or complete a balance transfer to lower the interest rate on your debt. With a lower rate, more of your payment goes toward principal rather than interest, helping you save money and get out of debt faster.</p><p>Credible allows you to compare interest rate estimates from multiple <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> lenders at once.</p><h2>Getting the help you need</h2><p>Dealing with debt can be an exhausting experience, but debt relief may be able to help you through it.

Not only does this keep your home free and clear of another mortgage, but it also means closing costs can be low (no appraisal fee) and money can be available within days (or less for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day personal loans</a>). Loan funds are deposited in your bank account and you can use the money to pay your contractor. Over the next several years (depending on the terms of your loan), you’d make monthly payments to the lender until you’ve repaid the amount borrowed plus interest.</p><p>Rates can be as low as 6.49%, but are generally only available if you have excellent credit. With good credit, you can expect rates in the mid-teens, depending on the length of the repayment term. With fair credit, expect rates in the mid- to high-20s.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>If you’ve built up enough equity in your home, you may be able to borrow against it with a&nbsp;<a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a>. Unlike a personal loan, a home equity loan is considered a “<a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-second-mortgage\">second mortgage</a>,” meaning your house serves as collateral on the loan. And since the value of your home needs to be appraised, these loans can take weeks longer to close than unsecured loans.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit is that home equity loans typically have lower interest rates than personal loans, especially if you have a \"good\" or “very good” FICO credit score (between 670 and 799). &nbsp;Repayment terms are longer as well — up to 30 years, in some cases — which makes for a low monthly payment. The flipside is that even with a lower interest rate, a longer repayment term could mean thousands more spent in interest. Home equity loans are best if you have a big roofing job that you can wait to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312890":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312890","content":"<p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">Personal Loan vs. Home Equity Loan</a></p><h3>Home equity line of credit</h3><p>Similarly, a&nbsp;home equity line of credit (<a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">HELOC</a>) lets you borrow against the equity in your home. In this case, however, you’ll have an open line of credit from which you can borrow as needed during the draw period (often five to 10 years).

The draw period is followed by a repayment period (often up to 20 years), when you'll pay back both the principal borrowed and interest.</p><p>HELOCs are helpful if you’re funding various home improvement projects over a few years.

Max loan terms range from 12 to 20 years (again, depending on the type of home).</li><li><strong>FHA 203(k) loans:</strong> These loans can be used to finance major and minor home repairs.

Grants, which are available only to those age 62 or older, have a lifetime limit of $10,000 and can be used only for the removal of health and safety hazards.</li></ul><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Paying for major expenses with a credit card can be expensive if you’re unable to pay off all the charges before your next due date. Credit cards typically have high, variable interest rates, and your debt will continue to climb each month if you make only minimum payments. Think of your credit card as a last resort, unless you can pay off the expense within a month.</p><p>One exception, however, is if you qualify for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR promotional period</a>. Promotional or introductory periods may last up to 21 months, during which time you could potentially pay off all roof-related expenses interest-free. Just be careful with 0% APR financing offers. It’s imperative to repay the loan before the APR adjusts to avoid paying interest at the card’s standard APR, which could be around 30% or higher.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better?</a></p><h3>Contractor financing</h3><p>Many contractors offer their own financing, either in-house or through third-party lenders.

The APR includes the interest rate plus&nbsp;any upfront fees, such as an&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>. A lower APR is generally better, as long as you can afford the monthly payment.</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms</strong>: <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">Personal loan repayment terms</a> typically range from two to seven years, although some lenders offer shorter or longer terms. For instance, LightStream offers terms between two and 20 years for home improvement loans. Home equity loans and HELOCs have terms up to 30 years. The length of the repayment term affects the size of your monthly payments and your total interest costs over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Look at loan amounts</strong>: Get a quote from your contractor so you know how much the job will cost. Then make sure any lender or loan you’re considering <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">allows you to borrow that much</a>.

Some private lenders also have a minimum enrollment requirement.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>FAFSA submission (for federal student loans):</strong>&nbsp;To access federal loans and other types of financial aid, you'll need to submit the FAFSA for every year you're in school.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sufficient credit and income (for private student loans):</strong> If you're borrowing from a private lender, you'll need to meet its financial requirements or apply with a creditworthy cosigner to qualify for a loan.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Other ways to pay for studying abroad</h2><p>Student loans aren't your only option for studying abroad.

To find and apply for scholarships, search through scholarship databases and check with your school's financial aid or study abroad office.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>University exchange programs:</strong> Some colleges partner with schools overseas to provide exchange programs abroad.

Here are a few tips for managing your loans while you're abroad:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Set up your online accounts</strong>: Create online accounts with your loan servicers so you can review your loan balances, interest rates, and other details. You can also sign in to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://studentaid.gov\">StudentAid.gov</a> for this information, but you'll need a separate account with your loan servicer to make payments. Hold on to your login credentials so you can access your accounts when you need them.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review your repayment status:</strong> Your loans may be in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> while you're studying abroad, but not every private lender offers this option. Find out whether you need to make payments, and when your first payment is due, so you're prepared.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider making payments: </strong>Even if you don't have to make payments yet, you could elect to make small monthly payments or interest-only payments while you're studying abroad. That way, you can cut down on interest charges and have a smaller balance waiting for you after graduation. Consider setting up autopay to make things easy and likely score a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-interest-rate\">discount on your interest rate</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Update your contact information:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure your loan servicer and school have your current email and phone number so you don't miss any important communications about your financial aid.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maintain your course load:</strong>&nbsp;You generally must make satisfactory academic progress to remain eligible for student loans, which involves earning enough credits each semester. Maintain the course load you're enrolled in, so you don't lose your financial aid eligibility.</li></ul><p>Walter also recommends building a savings account, so you have a financial cushion while waiting for your student loan money to arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>“Federal loans and aid are often disbursed closer to when the semester begins, so if you were planning on using a refund to pay for books or other educational expenses while abroad, you may not receive those funds for a few weeks after the semester begins,” she explains. “Have a plan on how you will pay for those things.”</p><p>You may also have to take into account travel expenses and exchange rates.

Not all personal loans are created equal.

Check your credit score for free using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">Credible's credit-monitoring tool</a> and see how your score matches up with lenders you're considering.</p><h3>Consider APRs</h3><p>Personal loan APRs, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rates</a>, account for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/origination-fees\">origination fees</a>. APR represents the annualized cost of borrowing. With a purchase as big as a pool, getting a lower APR could save you a significant amount of money on interest.</p><h3>Consider term length carefully</h3><p>Choosing a shorter pool loan repayment term can save you a lot of money in interest, but it might not be the best move. The shorter the loan term, the higher the monthly payment becomes (since you’re paying the loan back in fewer months).</p><p>Adding a large loan payment to your monthly budget might be difficult, especially as your pool can also involve higher utility bills, maintenance costs, and an increased homeowners insurance premium. Try to find the best balance between a monthly payment you can comfortably afford and total interest costs over the life of the loan.</p><h3>Prequalify with a handful of lenders</h3><p>To make the best decision, prequalify with multiple lenders online. Review the fine print of each to understand:</p><ul><li>If each lender offers loan amounts large enough to cover the cost of the pool</li><li>The APR being offered by each lender</li><li>The repayment terms available to you</li><li>The resulting monthly payment with each lender</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:310742":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"310742","content":"<h2>How to get a pool loan</h2><ol><li>Get a pool estimate.

However, HELOC rates are variable, which means your rate could change over time based on market conditions. As a result, your monthly payment could change monthly as well. You could also lose your home if you can’t keep up with payments.</p><p>HELOCs are divided into draw and repayment periods. During the draw period, you can draw from your line of credit and make interest-only payments on what you pull out. During the repayment period, you can’t draw from your HELOC and your monthly payments include principal and interest.</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">Home equity loans</a> are very similar to personal loans in that you make fixed monthly payments based on a fixed interest rate, and you receive the money upfront.

Why the scarcity? Cost. Pools can be one of the most expensive additions to a home, often costing tens of thousands of dollars. Covering that kind of expense with cash may be impossible for many, but personal loans provide a relatively affordable (and quick) way to finance a swimming pool. Other options include home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and contractor financing. </p></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="compare-interest-rates-on-pool-loans">Compare interest rates on pool loans</h2></section><section class="mb-32 styles_lendersTableContainer__ZvSxy"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S styles_tooltip__43fLu" tabindex="0"><a class="styles_disclosure__yBefs styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_disclaimer__B6kQy styles_regular__DTF41 styles_accent__6s3_k" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Advertiser Disclosure</a></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><p class="styles_disclaimer__B6kQy">The rates that appear are from companies from which Credible receives compensation.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

The platform offers loans from a wide range of lenders, and next-day funding is available. Loans are available up to $100,000 if you apply via Splash’s website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are competitive, but borrowers with excellent credit may find lower APRs elsewhere.

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

The platform offers loans from a wide range of lenders, and next-day funding is available. Loans are available up to $100,000 if you apply via Splash’s website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are competitive, but borrowers with excellent credit may find lower APRs elsewhere.

In other cases, they could be a revolving line of credit that you use to pay pool cost expenses as they’re due. Common types of installment loans used to finance a pool include personal loans and home equity loans. Revolving credit lines include HELOCs and credit cards. Builder financing may also be an option.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_tip__LuW2g"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="tip Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_tipImg__EX55M"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_tipTitle__RIk_D styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tip</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">Pool loans typically fall into the category of home improvement loans.
