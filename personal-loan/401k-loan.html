Also, if you leave your job before repaying, you could be on the hook for withdrawal taxes and penalties. Consider alternatives, like a personal loan or HELOC, before dipping into your retirement savings.&nbsp;</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should you use a 401(k) loan to pay off credit card debt?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A 401(k) loan has much lower interest rates than most credit cards. But just because you can use a 401(k) loan for this purpose doesn’t mean you should. If you’re struggling to pay back debt and can’t qualify for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-loans-for-fair-credit\">traditional debt consolidation loan</a>, be very wary of sacrificing your 401(k).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credit card debt is unsecured, which means it’s often dischargeable in bankruptcy, while your 401(k) is typically protected from creditors and not subject to liquidation in bankruptcy proceedings. If you already have bad credit, a 401(k) loan may not be the way to go, unless you’re confident you can get back on track.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take for a 401(k) loan to be approved?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A 401(k) loan may be processed, finalized, and funded within a few business days. However, some loans can take up to one month to finalize.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How soon can I take out a 401(k) loan after paying one off?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>It depends on your plan’s rules. Some plan administrators let you have more than one 401(k) loan at a time, while others may limit you to only one with waiting periods of a few days to a few months.&nbsp;</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will my employer know if I take a 401(k) loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes — if your plan is employer-sponsored, you’ll usually need to go through your employer to request a 401(k) loan.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if you have a 401(k) loan and change jobs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You’ll need to pay your loan back in full if you leave your job. If not, you’ll get charged income tax plus a 10% penalty on the withdrawal if you’re under 59½. You may have a grace period during which to do so, such as 90 days from your termination date.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Who gets the interest on a 401(k) loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You’re both the borrower and lender of a 401(k) loan, so any interest you pay returns to your 401(k) account. Still, that’s extra money you’ll need to account for each month to repay your loan.&nbsp;</p>"}}]}

first-time homebuyer tax credit was a program that encouraged homeownership in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

If you’re in the process of repaying the loan, there are some important points to consider.</p><h2>What is the first-time homebuyer tax credit?</h2><p>The first-time homebuyer tax credit was initially available to eligible homebuyers who purchased qualifying homes in 2008. The credit was worth up to 10% of the home’s purchase price, for a maximum credit of $7,500. It acted as an interest-free loan, so people who claimed the credit on their 2008 tax returns had to repay it over the course of 15 years, starting in 2010 and ending in 2024.</p><p>The tax credit was extended in 2009 to include home purchases through April 30, 2010, and buyers had until June 30, 2010, to close on homes. In 2010, the deadline for closing on a home purchase was changed to Sept. 30, 2010.

But if the person claimed the credit on a joint return, the surviving spouse will need to continue repaying their half of the credit.</p><h3>Divorce</h3><p>You can also avoid repaying the credit if you get divorced and transfer the home to your ex-spouse as part of the settlement. In that case, your former partner would be responsible for paying back the remaining balance.</p><h3>Government service employees</h3><p>Selling your home won’t trigger full repayment if your federal government job requires you to move.</p><h3>Condemnation or threat of condemnation</h3><p>Another exception applies if your home is destroyed or you sell the home under threat of condemnation to someone who isn’t related to you.

For example, consider the payment from the earlier amortization schedule, $2,697.98 for a 30-year mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 6%. You can divide the monthly payment by 28% to see what the monthly income should be ($2,697.98/0.28 = $9,635.64).

You can use a mortgage calculator to see what interest rates and terms could result in a payment that falls within 28% of your gross monthly income. For example, with a salary of $100,000, you’d calculate your monthly pre-tax income ($100,000/12 = $8,333.33). Then, multiply that by 28% to determine an affordable monthly payment ($8,333.33 x 0.28 = $2,333.33). For your payments to be affordable, it would be best not to exceed $2,333.33, depending on your other debts. You could also shop around for a lower interest rate or make a larger down payment, so you need to borrow less.&nbsp;</p>","readMoreUrl":null,"isExpanded":null,"readMoreTitle":null}]},{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksAuthorBox","author":{"__typename":"strapiAuthorType","fullName":"Aly J.

For example, Upstart is more accessible to borrowers with credit issues, is good for those who need a small loan, and offers near rock-bottom rates for borrowers with excellent credit. SoFi has larger loan amounts, is an FDIC-insured bank, and offers joint loans and more digital tools.</p><p>When comparing personal loans, it's helpful to consider the following features.</p><h3>APR range</h3><p>APR expresses the annual cost of the loan as a percentage of the loan amount. Lenders provide an APR range, and only borrowers with excellent credit scores and other strong financial criteria qualify for the lowest APRs. Upstart has a lower starting APR than SoFi, indicating that borrowers with excellent credit may be eligible for a better rate from Upstart. Unlike Upstart, SoFi's lowest APR requires that you set up autopay and direct deposit to a SoFi bank account.</p><h3>Minimum credit score</h3><p>SoFi doesn't publish a minimum credit score, but borrowers with fair or poor credit may struggle to qualify. That said, you could potentially apply with a co-borrower if you have fair credit, which could be a spouse or family member who has good or excellent credit and agrees to be jointly responsible for the loan.</p><p>Upstart doesn't allow you to apply with a co-borrower or cosigner, but the company's AI underwriting technology and numerous lending partners make it a better fit if you have credit issues. Applicants with a limited credit history may be able to qualify by meeting other financial criteria.</p><h3>Loan purpose</h3><p>Both Upstart and SoFi allow you to use your loan funds for a variety of purposes, including:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">Credit card consolidation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">Medical expenses</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">Home improvement</a></li><li>Large purchases</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-vacation-loans\">Travel</a></li></ul><p>While SoFi personal loans are strictly for personal and household expenses, some of Upstart's lending partners may allow you to use the funds to start or expand a small business. If you're an entrepreneur considering a personal loan for business purposes, Upstart is definitely the better option for you.</p><p>SoFi explicitly prohibits you from using a personal loan to pay for business expenses, real estate, investments, or college education. Upstart's lending partners may have their own exclusions, which will be outlined in your loan agreement.</p><h3>Repayment terms</h3><p>SoFi takes the cake for flexible repayment terms, with options ranging from two to seven years, while Upstart only offers three- or five-year terms. Since your repayment term impacts your monthly payment and interest rate, more options make it easier to find the best fit for your budget. Like most personal loan lenders, neither SoFi nor Upstart charges prepayment penalties, so you can choose to repay your loan early to save money on interest.</p><h3>Loan amount</h3><p>Upstart offers loans as small as $1,000 and as large as $75,000. But if you need more than that, SoFi is the better choice — the lender offers loan amounts up to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a>. But SoFi's minimum loan amount is $5,000, so it's not an option for people who need a small personal loan.</p><h3>Time to fund</h3><p>Both SoFi and Upstart offer fast funding. But if you need an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency loan</a>, you might get your money faster with SoFi. In most cases, SoFi can issue the loan funds the same day you're approved if you sign your loan documents before 6 p.m. ET on a business day. Upstart sends funds the next business day for applicants who accept a loan before 5 p.m. ET on a business day.</p><h2>How to apply for a personal loan</h2><p>The process of applying for a personal loan is fairly similar across loan providers, though SoFi and Upstart may ask for slightly different information.</p><p>Generally speaking, you'll follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Use a loan marketplace site like Credible to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify</a> with SoFi, Upstart, and a few other lenders.</li><li>Compare APRs, repayment terms, monthly payments, and total interest.</li><li>Choose a loan option with a low APR and a monthly payment you can afford.</li><li>Authorize a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a> and proceed with the formal application.</li><li>Answer additional questions and upload documents that prove your income.</li><li>If approved, review your loan agreement carefully.</li><li>E-sign your loan documents to get the funds deposited in your bank account or sent to your creditors.</li></ol><h2>Which lender is best for you?</h2><h3>Best for limited credit history: Upstart</h3><p>Upstart may be a good fit if you have a limited credit history, especially if you're a college graduate with a job or offer of employment that provides sufficient income for loan payments. Upstart lenders consider your educational attainment and earning potential and may approve you for a loan even if you have a short history of credit use.</p><p>If you don't qualify for a personal loan, Upstart offers short-term loans up to $2,500 with APRs capped at 36% as an alternative to a payday loan. Plus, you can potentially extend the loan term (and lower payments) as you build credit.</p><h3>Best for debt consolidation: SoFi</h3><p>You're not required to pay an origination fee to get a loan from SoFi, and the bank will pay your creditors directly. That makes SoFi a slightly better option for debt consolidation, especially if you have a large amount of credit card debt or many open credit card accounts.</p><p>The option to apply jointly with your spouse is also great if you have shared credit cards - SoFi will consider income from both borrowers when making a lending decision.</p><h3>Best for home improvement: SoFi</h3><p>The combination of high borrowing limits and long repayment terms makes SoFi ideal for financing expensive home improvement projects while keeping monthly payments affordable. If you're remodeling your home to increase its value because you plan to sell, you might also consider choosing SoFi for your new mortgage. You may be eligible for a discount on your home loan origination fee for having a current or prior SoFi personal loan.</p><h3>Best for small business owners: Upstart</h3><p>If you're starting a business or trying to expand a new business, you may have difficulty qualifying for a business loan. A personal loan from Upstart may be the next-best option, as some of Upstart's lending partners allow you to use personal loan funds for business, and rates are very competitive for applicants with excellent personal credit scores.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:248682":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"248682","content":"<p>When you're applying for a mortgage, the lender will usually pull your credit score as part of the approval process.</p><p>Most consumer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">credit scores</a> range from 300 to 850, but you don't need the best score possible to qualify for the lowest mortgage rates.

Below are some common personal loan alternatives:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit cards:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Credit cards</a> provide a revolving line of credit you can borrow against and repay each month. If you carry a balance, you'll be charged interest — likely at a higher rate than with a personal loan. If you can pay off your balance within the card's grace period (typically one billing cycle), you could borrow interest-free.</li><li><strong>Home equity financing:</strong> If you own a home, you may be able to borrow against your home equity with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a>. These options often have lower interest rates compared to personal loans, but they come with additional risk. If you default on the loan, you can lose your house. Since your home needs to be appraised, it also takes much longer to approve and fund.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Offered by federal credit unions, PALs allow credit union members to borrow up to $2,000 with repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 months. These loans are much more affordable than traditional payday loans — APRs are capped at 28%. You can't take out more than 3 loans over a 6-month period.</li><li><strong>“Buy now, pay later” (BNPL) loans:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL loans</a> are short-term installment loans you can use to split up purchases into multiple payments. Some BNPL loans don't charge interest but come with late fees for missed payments. Others are similar to traditional personal loans, with APRs up to 36%. These loans are often available online, but you can use them in stores, too.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These apps let you borrow against your next paycheck. They don't charge interest, but most request tips and charge fees to send funds instantly. Some also charge subscription fees.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\">9 Personal Loan Alternatives</a></p><h2>How to apply for a personal loan</h2><p>Applying for a personal loan is easy with a few simple steps:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Get prequalified</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Use prequalification to get quotes from multiple lenders. Prequalification won't affect your credit score, but remember that it provides estimates of rates and terms rather than offers of credit. You'll need to formally apply to get a loan offer, and the hard credit check typically required for a loan application could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for as long as 1 year.</li><li><strong>Compare quotes:</strong> Once you've prequalified, compare potential rates and terms. Then, choose a lender based on customer reviews and the company that has the lowest interest rate, fees, and loan term that works best for you.</li><li><strong>Decide how much you need to borrow:</strong> Borrowing more money than you need is financially risky and could also affect your chances of qualifying. Consider your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) and how much additional debt you can afford to take on. For personal loans, lenders typically prefer that you have a DTI below 36%.</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> You'll need to provide basic information, such as your Social Security number, monthly income, and monthly rent or housing payment.</li><li><strong>Provide any documents your lender needs:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Requirements vary by lender</a>, but you may need to provide documentation to prove your employment and income, like tax returns, bank statements, pay stubs, or proof of address. You'll also need to provide proof of your identity, such as a driver's license or passport.</li><li><strong>Sign for the loan and receive funds:</strong> If you're <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">approved for a loan</a>, you'll sign a loan agreement. Then, the lender will send your loan funds, typically by&nbsp;<a href=\"\">direct deposit</a> <a href=\"\">to your bank account</a>. You can typically manage your payments directly on the lender's website.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">How To Apply for a Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:309730":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"309730","content":"<h2>Interest rates and loan amounts by credit score</h2><p>If you’re ready to apply for a personal loan and are curious how likely you are to qualify, what rate you might get, or how much money you might be approved to borrow, take a look at the charts below, which are based on 12 months of Credible loans data.</p><h3>APRs, amounts, and prequalification rates by credit score and income</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:309734":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"309734","content":"<p>Borrowers with the highest credit scores are likely to qualify for the lowest interest rates and highest loan amounts.

It found that affordable tuition and financial aid packages were a top consideration for 46% of students.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-pay-for-college\">How To Pay for College</a></p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cost-of-college\">college costs</a> vary significantly between institutions. For example, an immediate difference between public vs. private colleges is their price.</p><p>In addition to tuition and mandatory fees — like first-year student fees, environmental fees, and health center fees — a school's cost of attendance includes expenses such as food, housing, books, supplies, and transportation.</p><p>Compare college costs by finding the “net cost” of attending each school. The net cost is the cost of attendance, minus <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> you've received. This represents your true out-of-pocket cost. Schools often provide their own net cost calculator tools, which you can find directly on their website or by searching for the school in the Department of Education's <a href=\"https://collegecost.ed.gov/net-price\">Net Price Calculator Center</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/\">College Scorecard</a> is another useful tool that offers a snapshot of a school's average annual net price. For an itemized, in-depth overview of each college's costs, use the National Center for Education Statistics' <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/\">College Navigator</a>.</p><p>“The best way to make a fair comparison is to put the official financial aid offers side by side. Look not only at how much aid is given, but at the ratio of grants to loans,” says Chanin.</p><p>“Two schools with similar 'net costs' on paper can feel very different if one is packaging mostly loans and the other is offering renewable scholarships,” she explains.</p><p>A hidden cost that's sometimes overlooked, according to Kevin Ladd, chief operating officer of <a href=\"https://www.scholarships.com/\">Scholarships.com</a>, is going home for the holidays. If you plan on visiting family during break or even on the weekends, how far each school is from home and its travel cost — for example, a three-hour drive vs. a three-hour flight — should be considered to determine the true cost of attending a school.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-apply-for-student-loans\">How To Apply for Student Loans</a></p><h2>Compare academics and majors</h2><p>A school that offers your dream degree might be at the top of your must-have list. When comparing academics between schools, look at department rankings, student-faculty ratios, and prerequisites and graduation requirements. These factors can closely influence your experience while working toward your degree.</p><p>“It's worth looking closely at class size, not just in broad averages but in how the classes are structured,” says Chanin.</p><p>“Almost every college will have larger introductory lectures, but the real question is: Are there opportunities to break those down into smaller discussion groups? Are there seminars, labs, or writing-intensive courses where students can work closely with faculty? That balance between breadth and intimacy says a lot about the academic culture,” she adds.</p><h2>Look at campus life and location</h2><p>The EAB survey revealed that first-time college students said location was the number one factor for choosing their school. Campus culture and the school's local community can shape your entire college experience. Some areas to compare include:</p><ul><li><strong>School size: </strong>Ask yourself what type of atmosphere you'd thrive in. A large school, for example, might offer more extracurricular activities, but for some students, an expansive campus can feel isolating. Conversely, a small school might offer a strong sense of community for some, but have limited resources to reinvest into the student body.</li><li><strong>Urban vs. rural:</strong> Is the campus immersed in the hustle and bustle of an urban area, or is it the center of activity for the surrounding rural town? Are parks, museums, restaurants, shopping centers, and public transportation easily accessible, and is this important to you?</li><li><strong>Weather:</strong> Over time, the daily forecast can make or break your mood. Think about how climate affects you, and whether you prefer temperate weather or if you're open to locations with extreme hot or cold seasons.</li><li><strong>Housing options:</strong> If you're considering a school that's away from home, but aren't signing up for a dorm room, scope out the local rental market. You'll want to explore affordable neighborhoods in the area, public transit or walkability, safety rankings, and access to grocery stores and shops.</li><li><strong>Student life:</strong> What type of campus organizations and clubs are offered by the school? What do students typically do during downtime and session breaks? Is there a strong sense of school spirit or community that's refreshing and inspiring?</li></ul><p>“A common mistake I notice is when families try to make this decision entirely comparative, as though the process can be reduced to lining up two or three schools and checking which has the 'better' numbers in each category,” says Chanin, who emphasizes that although these data points are important, they don't tell the whole story.</p><p>“What they leave out is how it actually feels to be a student on that campus day to day, whether the student feels energized or supported by the environment around them,” she notes.</p><p>Virtual campus tours can offer a glimpse into the layout and tone of a school and its students. They're useful if budget constraints prevent students and their families from traveling to see multiple campuses. If you can manage an in-person tour, Ladd echoes the value of experiencing campus life for yourself.</p><p>“You probably wouldn't buy a house, horse, or car without seeing them in person,” says Ladd.</p><p>“You really shouldn't make a decision on where to attend college until you have spent an afternoon there, walking the grounds and hearing firsthand from someone who is attending or has attended that college recently,” he advises. “You may discover several 'it' factors per school by taking the time to visit.”</p><h2>Consider outcomes and long-term value</h2><p>Ultimately, the college experience is designed for personal development and to prepare you for a career. For 28% of first-time students, demonstrated job success for graduates was a top factor in choosing a college, according to the EAB survey.</p><p>The College Scorecard provides students with average outcomes of students who were enrolled as first-time students at a school. This information can be used to compare college costs against future financial earnings and debt.</p><p>Below are some data points it provides:</p><ul><li><strong>Graduation rates:</strong> This is the percentage of students who graduated within 8 years of enrolling as a first-time student.</li><li><strong>Starting salaries: </strong>College Scorecard data shows the median starting salary of students who received financial aid and enrolled at the school 10 years prior, regardless of whether they completed their degree.</li><li><strong>Median total student debt:</strong> This figure is the median cumulative federal student loan debt that undergraduate students typically have upon leaving the school.</li></ul><p>Be wary of relying solely on numbers to decide the lifelong value of a school. In addition to the data, evaluate the department's quality of academic advising, whether the school's alumni network is robust and engaged, and whether students are well-positioned for pivotal internships or offered other opportunities for long-term career development.</p><p>“When thinking about career outcomes, I recommend focusing less on the averages and more on the pathways: the advising, the internships, the alumni connections, and the support structures that get students from the classroom to their next step,” says Chanin. “Those are the levers that determine whether a student leaves with momentum.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:13194":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"13194","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:309742":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"309742","content":"<p>Quite a few lenders offer loans if you have a 500 credit score.

But SoFi offers much larger loans — up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a> if you can qualify — so the bank may be a better fit for people who need to <a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">finance home remodeling</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/ivf-loans\">IVF treatment</a>, or other large expenses.&nbsp;</p><h3>Time to fund</h3><p>SoFi offers same-day funding for some, but Discover funded loans faster for most borrowers, according to Credible data on loans closed with both lenders over the past year. If you’re looking for an&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency loan</a>, you may get your cash faster with SoFi if you’re approved and can sign your documents before 6 p.m. ET on a business day —&nbsp; as long as you’re not using the funds to pay creditors directly. Discover typically sends the funds to your bank account the next business day after you sign.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>How to apply for a personal loan</h2><p>While the&nbsp;personal loan application process varies from one lender to the next, you can generally expect to follow these steps when applying for a loan with SoFi or Discover.</p><ol><li><strong>Evaluate your finances:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-check-credit-score\">Check your credit score</a> to get a sense of whether you’ll qualify with either SoFi or Discover. Then, consider <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">your budget</a> to determine how much of a loan payment you can afford.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong>&nbsp;Check your rate with SoFi, Discover, and a few other&nbsp;personal loan lenders by entering your Social Security number and desired loan amount. This step only requires a soft credit check, so it won’t impact your credit score. Bear in mind that the prequalified APR is only an estimate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Choose the best option:</strong>&nbsp;SoFi and Discover may offer you a choice of repayment terms. Generally speaking, you should choose the option with the lowest APR, as long as you can afford the monthly payment. Also, compare options based on other factors, like the total interest, incidental fees, and the lender’s track record of customer service.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Formally apply:</strong>&nbsp;Proceed with the <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">formal application</a>. This typically triggers a hard credit check, which may cause a slight decline in your credit score. You may need to upload documents that prove your identity and income.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sign your loan agreement:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re approved, make sure the final rate and term still meet your needs. After carefully reviewing the terms and conditions, e-sign your loan documents.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get the cash:</strong>&nbsp;While the exact timeline will depend on your application and where you bank, you can expect to receive the loan funds in your bank account within a few days.</li></ol><h2>Which lender is best for you?</h2><h3>Best for debt consolidation: SoFi</h3><p>Unlike Discover, SoFi doesn’t restrict borrowers from directly paying off credit card debt from certain issuers. SoFi offers the option to send the loan funds directly to your creditors and even offers a discount if you use more than half your loan funds for this purpose. SoFi also <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-refinance-a-personal-loan\">offers refinancing</a>, so it’s possible to get a lower interest rate once you’ve paid down your debt balances.</p><h3>Best for low rates: Discover</h3><p>If you have excellent credit, you may qualify for a lower rate with Discover than SoFi, which could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the course of your loan. Discover offers APRs as low as 7.99%. You don’t need to enroll in autopay to qualify for the lowest rate, either.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for large loans: SoFi</h3><p>While Discover caps loan amounts at $40,000, SoFi offers large personal loans up to $100,000. That makes SoFi a great choice for costly expenses like <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">medical bills</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement</a> projects. The bank’s seven-year repayment term option also provides for affordable monthly payments on large loans.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for small loans: Discover</h3><p>Discover offers personal loans in amounts as low as $2,500. That makes the bank a better fit for borrowers who need cash for smaller expenses like auto repairs or veterinary bills, since SoFi’s minimum loan amount is $5,000.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for emergencies: SoFi</h3><p>SoFi is known for fast funding. If you sign your loan documents by 6 p.m. ET on a business day, there’s a high likelihood you’ll get the cash in your bank account that day. If you <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">urgently need cash</a> for a home repair or other emergency expense, SoFi may be a better fit than Discover.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:305674":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"305674","content":"<p>If you're looking for a low-interest personal loan, you've come to the right place.

This involves a soft credit check (so no harm to your score) and a few minutes of your time. You won't get loan offers, but lenders will reveal what they <i>might</i> offer based on basic info you input and the soft credit pull. (When you apply, most lenders conduct a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">hard credit pull</a> that could ding your score for up to one year.)</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li><strong>Compare APRs:</strong>&nbsp;APR, or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, considers both the interest rate and any upfront fees to give a true measure of your overall borrowing costs per year for any particular loan. Personal loan lenders are required to advertise APR ranges, so this comparison is relatively easy. APRs for personal loans typically range from 6.49% to 35.99%.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms:</strong> Most lenders offer repayment terms <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">between 2 and 5 years</a>, with some offering 7-year repayment terms and longer. A longer repayment term can help you afford a large loan amount, while a shorter term can save you money on interest.</li><li><strong>Look at loan amounts:</strong> Many lenders offer loans up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a>. A few, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a>, offer loans as large as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a>.

Higher scores typically equate to lower rates and vice versa.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income:</strong> A high income can help you get a low rate, sometimes even if your credit isn’t perfect. At a minimum, your income should be sufficient to cover your current debt obligations plus the new one you want to take on.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\"><strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This simple calculation shows how much debt you have relative to your income. In other words, it tells lenders how much room you have in your budget for a new monthly payment. Most lenders prefer a DTI below 36% for personal loans, but the lower, the better.</li><li><strong>Loan purpose:</strong> What you intend to do with the loan can impact the rate you get. For instance, home improvement loans and credit card consolidation loans through LightStream tend to have lower interest rates compared to loans for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">medical expenses</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/ivf-loans\">family planning</a>.</li><li><strong>Repayment term:</strong> Shorter repayment terms tend to have lower interest rates and vice versa.

The credit union asks you a few questions and performs a soft credit pull to gauge not only if you’re likely to qualify, but also the rates you can likely get.</p><h3>Your credit score and financial history</h3><p>Although a minimum credit score isn’t disclosed, PenFed requires a full credit report inquiry if you apply for a loan. The resulting hard credit pull could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for up to one year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Your income and employment</h3><p>PenFed doesn’t disclose a minimum income requirement, but may request recent pay stubs, retirement statements, bank statements, or tax returns.</p><h2>PenFed personal loan purposes</h2><p>PenFed requires you to select the&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">purpose of your loan</a> during the application process from the following options:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Debit/credit card consolidation</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">Home improvements</a></li><li>Life and events</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">Medical</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/dental-financing\">dental</a></li><li>Tax loan</li><li>Transportation</li></ul><p>The lineup of allowed uses is pretty versatile, especially since the “life and events” option can cover many other purposes.

For example, on a standard 10-year repayment plan with a 6% interest rate, you’d pay about $888 a month. The exact amount depends on your interest rate, the amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/how-does-student-loan-interest-work\">accrued interest</a>, and the repayment plan you choose.</p><p>High student loan payments can strain your budget and leave you less room for savings or other priorities. A heavy debt load relative to your income can also make it harder to qualify for additional credit, such as a mortgage or auto loan. The good news is, there are strategies that can help you manage the cost and pay down your balance more efficiently.</p><h2>Refinance to pay off $80K faster</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Student loan refinancing</a> can help you pay off your debt faster and reduce the total interest you pay. To qualify for a lower rate and better terms, you’ll typically need a stronger credit score than when you first borrowed, or interest rates must have dropped since then.</p><p>If you can get a lower interest rate, refinancing $80,000 could save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. It can also combine multiple monthly payments into one, making your loans easier to manage.</p><p>While refinancing can lead to significant savings, it comes with trade-offs if you have federal loans. Refinancing federal loans means converting them to private loans and losing access to benefits like income-driven repayment and forgiveness programs.</p><p>“If you have a stable job, strong credit, and no real shot at qualifying for federal forgiveness, refinancing could help you save money and time,” says Andrew Latham, a certified financial planner (CFP) at SuperMoney.</p><p>“But if your income is variable, or you're eligible for federal programs like PSLF, it might be smarter to keep your loans federal, even if it means paying a bit more over time,” he advises.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pros-and-cons-of-refinancing-private-student-loans\">Should I Refinance My Student Loans? Pros and Cons&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Use the avalanche or snowball method</h2><p>If you have multiple student loans, the debt avalanche and debt snowball are two common strategies for paying them off faster.</p><ul><li><strong>Debt avalanche:</strong> Make the minimum payment on all your loans, then put any extra money toward the loan with the highest interest rate. Once that loan is paid off, move to the loan with the next highest rate. This strategy works well if you want to pay as little as possible on your loans.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Debt snowball:</strong> Make the minimum payment on all your loans, then put any extra money toward the loan with the smallest balance, no matter its interest rate. After that loan is paid off, apply the same approach to the loan with the next smallest balance. This method gives you quick wins early in the process, which can help you stay motivated to keep going.</li></ul><p>“I recommend prioritizing the debts by interest rate to ensure you are paying the high-interest debts first,” says Leslie H. Tayne, a financial attorney and founder of Tayne Law Group. She says this will save you more money in the long run and requires less legwork than increasing your income.&nbsp;</p><h2>Switch to biweekly payments</h2><p>Switching from monthly to biweekly payments is a simple way to pay off $80,000 in student loans faster and reduce interest charges. Instead of making one full payment each month, you make half of your monthly payment every two weeks. Because there are 52 weeks in a year, this schedule results in 26 half-payments (or the equivalent of 13 full payments) instead of the usual 12 per year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use windfalls to pay down your balance</h2><p>Making extra payments toward your principal loan balance is one of the most effective ways to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans\">pay off student loans faster</a>. If you receive unexpected funds, such as a tax refund, work bonus, or cash gift, consider putting them toward your student loan balance.</p><p>“Although it can be tempting to spend sudden income increases, allocating these funds to your loan balance instead will make a big difference in the long run,” explains Tayne.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:263966":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"263966","content":"<h2>Set up autopay for rate discounts</h2><p>Many loan servicers offer a 0.25 percentage point interest rate discount if you enroll in autopay.

These plans base your monthly payment on your income and family size. Depending on the plan, you could receive loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years.</p><p>However, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/trump-spending-bill\">One Bill Beautiful Bill Act</a>, signed into law in July 2025, introduces major changes to IDR plans starting in July 2026. The bill introduces a new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which replaces IDR plans and works differently from the current system. Even the lowest-income borrowers must make a minimum $10 monthly payment, regardless of family size.</p><p>Under RAP, monthly payments are still based on a percentage of your income. For example:</p><ul><li>Borrowers earning between $30,000 and $40,000 per year will pay 3% of their income.</li><li>Borrowers earning more than $100,000 per year will pay 10% of their income.</li><li>You can subtract $50 per dependent child from your calculated payment.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you’re currently enrolled in an IDR plan that will be discontinued, you’ll have until July 1, 2028, to choose between the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and RAP.

PSLF is available to borrowers who work for the government or a qualifying not-for-profit organization. After making 120 qualifying payments, you can have your remaining balance forgiven.</p><p>“If you are carrying a large balance like $80,000 or more, the current direction of federal loan policy under the Trump administration is not particularly borrower-friendly,” cautions Latham.</p><p>“Programs like PSLF still exist, but they are under heavy review. The Department of Education has begun scrutinizing past forgiveness approvals and signaling that it may start rejecting new applications more aggressively, even for public servants who believed they had met the requirements.”&nbsp;</p><p>Given these changes, Latham advises against relying on forgiveness as your primary repayment strategy.</p><p>“Take advantage of existing programs if you qualify, but assume that political and legal changes could limit or delay your access to relief. Build a repayment strategy that stands on its own and treat forgiveness as a nice bonus if it happens, not a guarantee.”</p><h2>Alternative ways to reduce student loan debt</h2><p>With a large balance, it’s worth exploring every option for reducing what you owe.

As the name suggests, this loan type uses your vehicle title as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/collateral-loans\">collateral</a>. In addition to a car, you can secure these loans with a motorcycle, truck, or other vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>You can borrow around 25% to 50% of your vehicle’s value with a car title loan. You generally have to own your vehicle outright, but you may be eligible with some lenders if you’ve paid off most of your loan.&nbsp;</p><p>A car title loan is a particularly risky way to borrow. Financing rates are extremely high, and if you can’t repay the loan, you could lose your car. In fact, these loans aren’t legal in all states.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do car title loans work?</h2><p>When you take out an auto title loan, you give the lender possession of your vehicle title in exchange for a loan. The lender charges you finance fees, often up to 25% monthly, which can equate to an APR of around 300%. You may also be charged additional charges, like origination and processing fees, which drive the cost even higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting a car title loan generally doesn’t involve a credit check. But lenders may require an inspection of the vehicle, and will need to see proof of insurance and a form of ID.&nbsp;</p><p>When your loan term ends and you repay the loan, interest, and any additional fees, you get your title back from the lender. However, if you can’t repay the loan on time, the lender may allow you to roll it over — for an additional fee plus financing charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how that might look:</p><ul><li>Say you take out a $1,000 car title loan that’s due in 30 days. The lender charges 25% per month plus a $50 origination fee. In total, you’d owe $300 plus the original $1,000 you borrowed — that translates to a 360% APR.&nbsp;</li><li>If you couldn’t repay the loan, the lender might let you roll it over for another 30 days, but tack on a $25 rollover fee to do so.&nbsp;</li><li>If you don’t repay the loan, the lender could repossess your vehicle. They can then sell it to recoup their losses, and in some cases, can keep all of the proceeds — regardless of how much you borrowed.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224430":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224430","content":"<h2>Why are car title loans risky?</h2><p>Any type of borrowing involves some degree of risk, but car title loans are especially dicey. Here are a few of the biggest risk factors to be aware of when it comes to car title loans:</p><ul><li><strong>You could lose your car:</strong> If you fall behind on payments, lenders can repossess your car and sell it. Unfortunately, this may be more common than you think: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/nodes/files/research-publication/crl-under-the-radar-illegal-autotitleloans-feb2025.pdf\">Center for Responsible Lending</a>’s survey found that more than 1 in 5 title loan borrowers who made late payments lost their car to repossession.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The cost of borrowing can be exorbitant:</strong>&nbsp;Car title loans may seem convenient, but they can be costly. Monthly finance fees can be as high as 25%, which equals an annual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/apr-vs-interest-rate\">APR</a> of about 300%. Plus, lenders may charge origination fees and application fees on top of financing charges. However, some states and lenders have lower fees and finance charges and longer repayment periods. Carefully compare title loan lenders before choosing one.</li><li><strong>Lenders don’t issue loans based on your ability to repay:</strong>&nbsp;“What borrowers may not realize is that the loan amount is rarely tied to any actual ability to repay the debt,” says Josh Richner, Founder of Faithworks Financial. While this can be risky for the borrower, it may actually benefit the lender, who Richner says can “make more on the loan through a repossession and sale of the vehicle.” Richner suggests borrowers remember that just because a lender issues you a loan doesn’t mean you can afford it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan rollovers can lead to a cycle of debt:</strong>&nbsp;The Center for Responsible Lending found that 64% of title loan borrowers couldn’t make all their payments on time — a risk that may be exacerbated by the short-term nature of some loans. Even if your lender allows you to roll over a car title loan, you’ll have to pay additional fees and interest on top of what you already owe, making it easy to get caught in a cycle of debt.</li></ul><h2>How to get a car title loan</h2><p>A car title loan should be a last resort. But if it’s your only option, you can get one by taking the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Find a lender:</strong> “First, research any lender you intend to apply with for a car title loan,” suggests Austin Rulfs, Director of Zanda Wealth. “I have witnessed too many customers sign into agreements with hidden fees, high interest rates, and low control terms.” Carefully review loan processes, fees, rates, and, if available, customer reviews. You should be able to find options near you by searching for car title loans online.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Apply online:</strong>&nbsp;Most lenders allow you to begin the application — if not complete it — online. You’ll have to provide information about your vehicle and auto insurance.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Provide documentation and get a vehicle evaluation:</strong>&nbsp;Along with your application, the lender will likely need to see your car. They’ll also require you to hand over your car title and provide certain documentation, like proof of insurance, income, and a form of ID. You may even need to provide a second set of keys.</li><li><strong>Review loan terms and sign:</strong>&nbsp;After you receive a loan offer, review the terms carefully before signing and receiving your funds. “Lenders with not-so-noble intentions make use of confusing contracts in order to make it easier on their part to repossess,” warns Rulfs. “Take an extra day to investigate and ask questions to prevent this problem.”</li><li><strong>Repay the loan:</strong>&nbsp;Pay the loan back, plus any fees and interest, by the predetermined due date. Keep in mind that a single late payment can have major consequences. Rulfs recalls an experience of a friend who took out a loan and made this mistake: “He lost the car he had because he forgot to make one payment of the loan, which was almost paid.” Once you’ve paid the loan back in full, you can get your title back.</li></ol><h2>Alternatives to auto title loans</h2><p>Because auto title loans involve so much risk, consider these alternatives when you’re short on cash:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224434":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224434","content":"<h3>Apply for a personal loan&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> offer much larger sums of money and longer repayment terms than auto title loans.

Whether you're earning cash back or points or miles, paying a student loan with a credit card can boost your earnings. While you can increase your rewards, the value will probably get eaten up by the cost of transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:263386":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"263386","content":"<h4>Meet spending minimums</h4><p>The top rewards credit cards on the market typically have enticing welcome bonuses. But to qualify for them, you typically need to meet a spending minimum of several thousand dollars in a short timeframe.</p><p>That can be tough with your regular spending. Paying a student loan with a credit card may help you easily meet those spending minimums so you can cash in on the bonus. However, there's a caveat. You generally need excellent credit to be eligible for these types of cards and they typically come with an annual fee.</p><h4>Save interest with 0% APR</h4><p>If you want to pay a student loan with a credit card, a 0% APR credit card could help. These credit cards offer 0% APR for a specific amount of time as part of the introductory or promotional period.</p><p>So if you paid your student loans with a 0% APR credit card and then paid off the balance in full during the introductory period, you could save money on interest. But you're still on the hook for the transaction fees when using third-party payment services for loans and you should proceed with caution.</p><p>“In dire situations, 0% credit cards can be a great tool. It gives you a window of opportunity to pay down debt without interest. But you have to be educated. Lenders offer 0% interest for a period of time, usually 12 to 18 months, and then it kicks back in. So they aren't a long-term solution,” says Crissi Cole, founder and CEO at Penny Finance, a digital financial planning platform with a mission to close the wealth gap.</p><h4>More options</h4><p>When you make a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-monthly-student-loan-payment\">student loan payment</a>, you typically have one option — to use your bank account. If you choose to pay a student loan with a credit card, you have far more options. If you're rewards-savvy, you can select the credit card that would work best for your goals and needs. As noted above, you can also see if you qualify for a 0% APR credit card.</p><h3>Cons</h3><h4>High transaction fees</h4><p>Using third-party payment services for loans such as Plastiq can be convenient but comes at a cost. Plastiq has transaction fees for card payments at 2.9%. Additionally, the company has delivery fees for ACH/EFT/Electronic of $0.99.</p><p>So there's no getting around the extra cost. If you're using a credit card to get more rewards, these fees reduce your overall earnings. If you want to use credit because you don't have cash in the bank, this can add to your total costs.</p><h4>Higher APRs</h4><p>If you pay student loans with a credit card and don't plan to pay off the balance before your due date, you'll get hit with interest charges. Credit cards have much higher APRs than student loans and may be variable and subject to changes.</p><p>The average APR on all credit card accounts stood at 22.25% as of May 2025, according to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve data</a> available.</p><p>Interest rates on federal loans are fixed and are much lower. Rates for the 2025-26 school year are between&nbsp;6.39% and 8.94%. This is why it rarely makes sense to pay student loans with a credit card.</p><h4>Loss of federal loan benefits</h4><p>If you pay off your entire federal student loan balance and put it on a credit card, you'll lose out on some <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">important benefits</a>. For example:</p><ul><li>Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans</li><li>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</li><li>Deferment</li><li>Forbearance</li><li>Payment pauses, like during the COVID emergency</li></ul><p>These protections can't be understated and could be a huge benefit.</p><p>“Student loans, both private and federal, do come with forbearance provisions, and federal loans offer a variety of payment plans, none of which are offered on a credit card,” says Jack Wang, wealth adviser and college financial aid advisor at Innovative Advisory Group.</p><p>On top of these payment benefits and protections, you could be missing out on <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-interest-tax-deductible\">tax benefits</a> as well, whether you have federal or private student loans.</p><p>“A borrower with a student loan may be eligible to take the student loan interest tax deduction, based on their income,” says Wang. “But if they refinance the student loan onto a credit card, the interest is no longer deductible as the credit card was not a loan used, originally, to pay for qualified education expenses.”</p><h3>Balance transfer credit cards have limits</h3><p>While you can use a balance transfer credit card to move your student loan balance to a credit card, these cards have significant limits. They can offer introductory offers — such as a 0% APR for the first 12 months or more — but once that window ends, you’ll have to pay the card's standard APR if you fail to pay off the balance in time.</p><p>In addition, these cards often have limits on how much you can transfer, so you may not be able to transfer your entire balance. Finally, you’ll typically pay a balance transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the amount you transfer, which can add up quickly.</p><h4>Impact on credit utilization and credit score</h4><p>If you pay a student loan with a credit card and charge a significant balance, it will increase your credit utilization, which can reduce your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/credit-score\">credit score</a>. The amount you owe is a significant factor, making up 30% of your FICO credit score.</p><p>“To maintain the health of your credit, it's best practice to utilize 30% or less of your total credit limit,” says Cole. “This can easily get out of hand if the habit becomes using your credit card to pay other debts. High credit utilization equals more dings in your credit score.”</p><h2>Alternatives to paying student loans with a credit card</h2><p>If you're looking to pay student loans with a credit card because you're struggling financially, you have other options that are safer and offer more benefits. Here are some better <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-repayment-help\">student loan payment alternatives</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: </strong>If you have federal loans, you may qualify for as little as $0 monthly payments on an income-driven repayment plan. When you go on an IDR plan, your monthly payments have an upper limit in place. Typically, they don't exceed around 10% to 20% of your discretionary income. Additionally, all IDR plans offer student loan forgiveness if you have a balance after 10 to 25 years, depending on the plan.</li><li><strong>Deferment or forbearance: </strong>If you're unemployed, experiencing economic hardship, or in cancer treatment, you may qualify for a deferment or forbearance that allows you to pause your payments.</li><li><strong>Refinance student loans: </strong>If you have excellent credit and a stable income, but your monthly payments feel overwhelming, student loan refinancing may help. When you refinance, you may be eligible for a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-interest-rate\">lower interest rate</a> and change your repayment term. Federal loan borrowers should exercise caution though as refinancing pays off your current loans, which means you'd no longer qualify for programs like IDR or student loan forgiveness.</li></ul>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:12274":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"12274","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"compare-rates"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:263978":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"263978","content":"<p>An Elastic line of credit is an easy way to get cash fast in an emergency.

The carried balance fee depends on how much you have left unpaid, but can range from $5 every two weeks to $350 a month.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Short repayment term:</strong>&nbsp;Billing due dates are based on your payday. If you get paid once a month, you’ll have a monthly payment due date; if you get paid semi-monthly (twice monthly), you’ll have semi-monthly payment due dates; and if you get paid weekly or bi-weekly, you’ll have bi-weekly payment due dates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Potential to form bad habits:</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, being able to repay what you borrow so quickly can be challenging. And once you have a recurring payment due date to Elastic, you may find it harder to afford your other existing bills — which can lead you to borrow&nbsp;more&nbsp;from your Elastic line of credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Not available everywhere:</strong>&nbsp;Elastic is currently unavailable in 17 states.</li></ul><p>Some of the drawbacks of an Elastic line of credit require more context. For example, the carried balance fees can equate to very high APRs. For instance, the carried balance fee on $10.01 is $10 — essentially a 100% APR. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> and other forms of credit measure the cost of borrowing through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a> (annual percentage rate), which accounts for the interest rate and any upfront lender fees.</p><p>Also, the short repayment terms with an Elastic line of credit require you to make a fast turnaround. While you only have to make the minimum required payment, the carried balance fees on whatever you don’t pay can be large. It’s to your benefit to pay in full by the next payment date every time you borrow, if possible.</p><h2>How to qualify for an Elastic line of credit</h2><p>When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">applying for a personal loan</a>, your credit score plays a big factor. However, Elastic may approve your application for a line of credit with bad credit (with some caveats, which we’ll explore next). Outside of the credit check, to qualify for an Elastic account, you simply need to:</p><ul><li>Live in a state where Elastic is offered</li><li>Have a regular source of income (or benefits) and a checking account</li><li>Be at least 18 years old</li></ul><h3>Your credit score and financial history</h3><p>While Elastic may approve your application with bad (or no) credit, your credit qualifications will impact your credit limit (how much you can borrow). In fact, the company reserves the right to obtain your credit report at any time to reassess your credit limit.</p><h3>Your income and employment</h3><p>Elastic requires a steady source of income or benefits to ensure you can repay what you borrow. Repayment schedules are built around when you get your paycheck (or benefits deposit).</p><h2>Elastic line of credit purposes</h2><p>Like a personal loan, you can use a line of credit for almost anything, from home renovations and high medical bills to moving and vacations. However, while line of credit and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">personal loan uses</a> are generally broad, we recommend only using Elastic’s line of credit for highly specific purposes, due to its high fees.</p><p>Specifically, we recommend Elastic line of credit for:</p><ul><li>Emergency expenses not in your budget</li><li>Periodic expenses not in your budget</li><li>Bills you can’t afford between paychecks</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:263998":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"263998","content":"<h2>Elastic line of credit fees and penalties</h2><p>Elastic’s fees are the biggest reason to be cautious of using the cash advance service. There are two main types of fees associated with an Elastic line of credit, and both can be quite expensive.</p><h3>Cash advance fee</h3><p>When you borrow money through your Elastic line of credit, you face a 10% fee. For instance, if you borrow $2,000, you must pay a fee of $200. You don’t have to pay that out of pocket. Instead, it comes out of the loan proceeds. In the $2,000 example, you would receive $1,800 and have to repay the full $2,000.</p><h3>Carried balance fee</h3><p>You’ll also pay a fee for any balance greater than $10 that you don’t repay by your next payment due date; this is similar to owing interest on any unpaid balance on a credit card after the payment due date.</p><p>While credit card interest is a percentage of your balance, Elastic charges a flat rate for unpaid balances, depending on your payment schedule and how much you still owe, from $0 to $350.</p><p>The table below breaks down this fee structure:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264002":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264002","content":"<h2>How Elastic compares to other lenders</h2><p>Elastic is a unique concept in that it functions both like a revolving line of credit and a cash advance app. Unlike other <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\">cash advance apps</a>, Elastic isn’t tied to your paycheck (though your income impacts your credit limit), and unlike other lines of credit, fees are flat rates instead of a percentage.</p><p>Keeping in mind its different structure, here’s how Elastic compares to a popular line of credit from a traditional bank (PNC) and compared to a popular cash advance app (EarnIn Cash Out).</p><h3>Elastic line of credit vs PNC line of credit</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264006":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264006","content":"<h2>How to contact Elastic</h2><p>You can contact Elastic for customer support by mail, phone, or email:</p><h3>By mail</h3><p>Send customer support inquiries to the following address:</p><p>Attn: Elastic Customer Support</p><p>4030 Smith Road</p><p>Cincinnati, OH 45209</p><h3>By phone</h3><ul><li>Call Elastic customer support at (888) 225-0080 (Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-10 p.m. ET, Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m.-6 p.m. ET)</li><li>Fax Elastic customer support at (888) 766-8160</li></ul><h3>By email</h3><p>You can email Elastic customer support at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@elastic.com\">support@elastic.com</a>.

Change your repayment plan</h2><p>The Standard Repayment Plan for federal student loans is a 10-year plan with equal monthly payments for the life of the loan.

This can be a good option for borrowers who expect to increase their income over time.</li><li><strong>Extended Repayment:</strong> Borrowers who owe more than $30,000 can extend their repayment over a maximum of 25 years. Your monthly payment may be fixed or graduated.</li><li><strong>Income-driven repayment:</strong> An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan extends your repayment term to 20 or 25 years and sets your monthly payment at a percentage of your discretionary income.

Consolidating allows you to combine your existing federal loans with a Direct Consolidation Loan, meaning you now only have one loan, one monthly payment, and one loan servicer to worry about.</p><p>Federal student loan consolidation doesn’t change the interest rate you pay on your various loans. Instead, the interest rate on your newly consolidated loan is a weighted average of the interest rates on the debts you consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of one percent.</p><p>Consolidation does give you the opportunity to extend your repayment term up to 30 years, which can reduce your monthly payment amount.

Your new loan will have different repayment terms, including a new interest rate and loan term length. If you qualify for a lower interest rate or opt for a longer repayment term, you can significantly reduce your monthly payment. This can be a good option for borrowers with excellent credit who qualify for the most favorable rates and terms.</p><p>Borrowers interested in refinancing should compare offers from multiple student loan refinancing lenders.

Research deferment and forbearance</h2><p>Federal student loan borrowers may be able to suspend their payments for a period of time through either deferment or forbearance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Deferment</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">Deferment</a> is a temporary payment pause on your student loans. During this time, interest may or may not continue to accrue, depending on your loan type. The following circumstances may qualify for federal student loan deferment:</p><ul><li><strong>Cancer treatment: </strong>This payment pause will last while you are undergoing cancer treatment and continues until 6 months after your treatment ends.</li><li><strong>Rehabilitation: </strong>Borrowers who are enrolled in an approved rehabilitation program designed to treat mental health issues or substance abuse may qualify for this deferment while in treatment.</li><li><strong>Economic hardship: </strong>If you're receiving a means-tested benefit like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, work full-time but earn below 150% of the federal poverty level, or are serving in the Peace Corps, you may be eligible for up to 3 years of economic hardship deferment.</li><li><strong>Unemployment: </strong>If you are unable to find full-time employment or you receive unemployment benefits, you may qualify for this deferment for up to 3 years.</li><li><strong>Graduate fellowship and in-school deferment: </strong>Borrowers enrolled in an approved graduate fellowship program or enrolled at least half-time at an eligible college may be eligible for this kind of deferment.</li><li><strong>Military service: </strong>Active-duty service members who are serving in response to war, a military operation, or a national emergency may be eligible for this deferment, which can last until 13 months after the end of the qualifying active-duty service. You may also be eligible if you completed active-duty service and a grace period.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Parent PLUS deferment: </strong>Parents who took out a Direct PLUS Loan for their child can qualify for a deferment while their child is enrolled at least half-time at an eligible school.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:275250":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"275250","content":"<h3>Forbearance</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forbearance\">Forbearance</a> gives you the option to pause payments or make smaller payments, but interest continues to accrue on your student loan balance during this time. This means applying for forbearance could significantly increase the amount you owe, depending on your interest rate and the amount of time your loan remains in forbearance.</p><p>Federal student loan borrowers may request a general forbearance from their loan servicer. Acceptable reasons include financial hardship, medical bills, a change in employment, or any other reason the loan servicer accepts. Loan forbearance is available for no more than 12 months at a time, with an aggregate limit of three years.</p><h2>5. Consider loan forgiveness or discharge programs</h2><p>Though the terms “forgiveness” and “discharge” both mean that a borrower is no longer responsible for paying their remaining student loan balance, these options are offered in very different circumstances.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan forgiveness</h3><p>Student loan forgiveness is generally when a borrower is relieved from paying the remaining balance of a loan after working at a qualifying job and making a certain number of payments. The most common federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">student loan forgiveness programs</a> include:</p><ul><li><strong>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF):</strong> Borrowers who work for a government or not-for-profit organization may be eligible to have their remaining balance forgiven under the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">PSLF</a> program.</li><li><strong>Teacher Loan Forgiveness: </strong>Borrowers who teach full-time for 5 consecutive academic years at a low-income elementary or secondary school, or an educational service agency, may be eligible for up to $17,500 of federal student loan forgiveness.</li><li><strong>Income-driven forgiveness:</strong> Borrowers who are enrolled in an IDR plan and make the required number of payments may have their remaining balance forgiven at the end of their loan term.</li></ul><h3>Loan discharge</h3><p>There are several reasons why your loan may be discharged, meaning you’re no longer responsible for repaying some or all of your loan. Reasons include total and permanent disability, fraud, or school closure.&nbsp;</p><h2>6. Look for state-based assistance programs</h2><p>Many states offer loan repayment assistance programs to help attract young workers in high-need professions. Health care, teaching, and law are among the most common fields that receive state-based loan assistance or grants. For example, <a href=\"https://worh.org/resources/for-the-workforce/loan-repayment/#1663163095569-3186b10b-fd7e\">Wisconsin offers up to $50,000</a> in education loan assistance to health care professionals who work full-time in a federally designated Health Professional Shortage Area.</p><p>Visit your state’s education department website to see if similar programs are offered in your area.</p><h2>7. Find other sources of funding</h2><p>There are a number of programs that may be able to help you pay down or pay off your student loans, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Employer assistance:</strong> The CARES Act included a provision that allows employers to give up to $5,250 to employees annually in tax-free student loan assistance, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended that provision until Dec. 31, 2025. Ask your employer if they’d be willing to start offering this perk.</li><li><strong>Relocation programs:</strong> These programs offer incentives to individuals to move to a certain area. Under <a href=\"https://www.tulsaremote.com/\">Tulsa Remote</a>, individuals who move to Tulsa while working a remote job outside of Oklahoma may be eligible for $10,000 in cash. The <a href=\"https://www.kansascommerce.gov/program/taxes-and-financing/rural-opportunity-zones-roz/\">Kansas Rural Opportunity Zones</a> program provides new full-time residents of any of 95 designated counties the potential for up to $15,000 in student loan repayment assistance.</li></ul><h2>8. Contact your loan servicer</h2><p>If you can’t afford your monthly student loan payment, contact your loan servicer as soon as possible. Let them know you’re having trouble making payments, and explain why. Ensure your loan servicer understands whether your financial hardship is chronic or temporary, since it may affect what solutions they offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Contacting your loan servicer can be one of the best ways to find out what payment-reduction options are available to you.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296566":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296566","content":"<p>Debt consolidation can help you lower your interest rate and monthly debt costs, and reduce the number of monthly payments you make.

For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/reprise-personal-loans-review\">Reprise</a> typically disburses loan funds electronically within 24 to 48 business hours. Note that it often takes longer for your creditors to receive the funds if you choose direct payment.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Potential for further credit damage:</strong> Applying for any loan typically requires a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a>, which has a slight negative impact on your credit score. While repaying your loan responsibly can improve your credit score, late or missed payments could further harm your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>May require an upfront fee:</strong>&nbsp;Most lenders that offer personal loans for bad credit charge an origination fee, an upfront fee that can reduce the amount you receive. Along with the interest rate, origination fees and other upfront lender fees are factored into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which represents the total annual borrowing cost.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Not ideal for extensive debt:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re overwhelmed with debt, lowering the APR may not make enough of a dent to help your situation. “When a person’s debt is more than their annual income or a person’s wages are being garnished, a debt consolidation loan generally is not the best option,” says Jillian Hishaw, owner and attorney at Hishaw Law LLC, a bankruptcy firm.</li><li><strong>May not address underlying issues:</strong>&nbsp;A debt consolidation loan won’t help you earn more income or spend less. If you’re struggling to manage your finances on a regular basis, you may want to get help from a credit counselor or check whether you qualify for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/benefits\">government benefits</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How to compare debt consolidation loans for bad credit</h2><p>The first step to getting any loan, especially if you have bad credit, is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loans/borrower/step/amount\">prequalify</a>. This is a way to quickly screen potential lenders to find those most likely to approve your application.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\"><strong>Review your credit score</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and income:</strong> Find lenders with minimum credit score and income requirements lower than yours.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compare loan amounts:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">Personal loans for bad credit</a> typically range from $1,000 to $35,000, depending on the lender. Make sure the lender offers the amount you need to consolidate your debt.</li><li><strong>Consider fees:</strong> In addition to interest, some personal loan lenders charge an origination fee, which may be deducted from the loan amount and affects how much cash you receive. If you’ve been able to prequalify with multiple lenders, compare each loan’s APR to get an idea of the total borrowing cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review repayment terms:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders offer longer repayment terms than others. If you’re on a tight budget, you can typically achieve a lower monthly payment by choosing a longer repayment term, but you may pay more in interest over time.</li><li><strong>Look for creditor-direct pay:</strong> Some debt consolidation lenders offer direct payment to your creditors, which eliminates the temptation to spend the loan funds on something else. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/achieve-personal-loans-review\">Achieve</a> offers to pay your creditors directly, and you could qualify for a rate discount with the autopay option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Find lenders that allow a cosigner or co-borrower:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders allow you to apply with a cosigner, which is someone who guarantees repayment of the loan, or a co-borrower, which is someone who is also responsible for the loan and has access to the funds. Applying with a cosigner or co-borrower who has good credit can help you qualify for a debt consolidation loan or get a lower APR.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Check lender reputation:</strong>&nbsp;Evaluate customer reviews on third-party websites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> to determine the lender’s reputation for customer service.</li></ol><h2>How to get a debt consolidation loan with bad credit</h2><ol><li>Add up all the debt you want to consolidate and note the interest rate you’re paying on each debt.</li><li>Prequalify using a loan marketplace like Credible to get APR estimates.</li><li>Compare loan options based on features like APR and repayment terms.</li><li>Choose the lowest-cost option with an affordable monthly payment.</li><li>Consider asking a friend or family member with good credit to cosign or apply jointly with you.</li><li>Proceed with the formal application and authorize a hard credit check (in most cases).</li><li>Upload any required documents, like proof of income.</li><li>Review the terms and conditions if you’re offered a loan.</li><li>E-sign your loan documents to get your cash or have the money sent to your creditors.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>Tips on improving your chances of approval</h2><p>Getting a debt consolidation loan with bad credit can be a challenge. If you’re struggling to get approved or to achieve a low enough APR to make debt consolidation worthwhile, consider the following tactics:</p><ul><li><strong>Consider bad credit lenders:</strong> A few online lenders specialize in serving borrowers with bad credit and may evaluate factors beyond your credit score. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/upstart-personal-loans-review\">Upstart</a> considers educational background when making lending decisions and accepts applicants with limited credit history.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Look to credit unions:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">Credit union personal loans</a> may be easier to qualify for than bank loans if you have bad credit. Credit unions are member-owned, not-for-profit institutions that offer lower rates and often consider other criteria when evaluating borrowers.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong>&nbsp;Some bad credit lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loans</a> for debt consolidation, which require you to offer a valuable asset as collateral. Securing the loan with an asset, like your vehicle title or a CD, can make it easier to qualify or get a lower APR. Just be aware that the lender can seize your collateral if you fail to repay.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner or co-applicant:</strong>&nbsp;Asking a friend or family member with good credit to guarantee the loan gives the lender reassurance and improves your odds of approval. While few lenders allow cosigners, many allow co-borrowers. Co-borrowers have equal access to the loan funds in addition to guaranteeing repayment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;It may be worthwhile to improve your credit score before applying for a debt consolidation loan. Use a tool like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.experian.com/credit/score-boost/\">Experian Boost</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.self.inc/lpg/mpa/rent-bills-landing/\">Self</a> to build credit via your on-time rent and utility payments. You can also improve your score by paying down debt, making on-time payments, and becoming an authorized user on the card of someone with good credit.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296590":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296590","content":"<h2>How to improve your credit score</h2><p>Here are a few steps you can take:</p><ol><li><strong>Dispute credit report errors:</strong> If you find errors on your credit report, <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/\">dispute them directly with the credit bureaus</a>. Assuming the reports are incorrect and you've supplied enough supporting information to the credit bureau, they may be removed from your credit report, along with any negative impact they had on your credit score.</li><li><strong>Address past-due debts:</strong> If you have any, pay them as soon as possible. Yes, your missed payments will still appear on your credit report. But getting out of delinquency will help improve your credit.</li><li><strong>Get a credit-builder loan:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">Credit-builder loans</a> come with shorter repayment terms — from six months to two years — and your funds are deposited into a locked savings account until you've paid off the loan. With this <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-types\">type of loan</a>, you'll make regular principal and interest payments that are reported to each of the three major credit bureaus, and you'll get your funds at the end of the loan term.</li><li><strong>Improve your payment history:</strong> Payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Set up autopay and calendar alerts for due dates to avoid missing payments.</li><li><strong>Reduce your credit utilization:</strong> You can improve your credit score by using less of your available credit on your cards or other revolving credit accounts. If you currently have <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/pay-off-credit-card-debt\">credit card debt</a>, consider paying some of it off before applying for a debt consolidation loan.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> This is one of the fastest and most effective ways to improve your credit score. Ask a loved one or friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card. You'll get credit for the positive payment history on your credit report and can benefit from their available credit, which can quickly boost your credit score.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/where-can-i-get-a-personal-loan\">Where to Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Alternatives to consolidating debt with bad credit</h2><h3>Debt management plan</h3><p>A nonprofit credit counseling agency can provide budgeting advice and also enroll you in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>, which is a type of debt consolidation. Under the plan, you’ll make one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, which will negotiate lower rates and fees with your creditors on your behalf.&nbsp;</p><h3>Balance transfer credit card</h3><p>Credit card issuers sometimes run promotions that allow existing cardholders to avoid interest on balance transfers from other credit cards — but only if your account is in good standing. Your credit card company may not notify you of this, so check your account for offers. Promotions can run for six months or longer, which could help you save money on debt repayment. However, many cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5%, that can offset your savings.</p><h3>Debt settlement</h3><p>When you go through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-settlement-pros-cons\">debt settlement program</a>, a company works to settle your debt on your behalf. For instance, the company may negotiate with lenders to accept a reduced amount. But debt settlement programs often require you to stop making payments as a negotiating tactic, which can harm your credit and possibly lead to legal action from your creditors. Plus, they can take years and results are not guaranteed. This is not a course we generally recommend.</p><h3>Bankruptcy</h3><p>Bankruptcy is a legal process that helps people get rid of debt. Depending on the type of bankruptcy, the court either oversees the liquidation of your non-exempt assets or the completion of a repayment plan. Most remaining debts are typically discharged.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-bankruptcy\">Bankruptcy</a> stays on your credit report for up to 10 years. If you have good credit, bankruptcy can cause a significant drop in your credit score. But if you already have poor credit, you might see an increase in your credit score once the debt is discharged. More importantly, you’ll have the opportunity to create good credit habits and improve your score once you’re debt-free.&nbsp;</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;32 lenders across 1,216 data points to find the best debt consolidation loans for bad credit.

Interest rates are typically fixed, so you can count on paying the same amount each month.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Flexible use of funds:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike financing through your dentist, which may be restricted to specific uses, you can use a personal loan for almost anything — including prescription medication, takeout, and covering a day’s lost wages.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lower APRs than traditional credit cards:</strong> Taking out a personal loan may be cheaper than carrying a balance on your credit card. The average APR on a 2-year personal loan is 11.14%, compared to an average of 21.39% for credit cards, according to Federal Reserve data.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Quick funding:</strong> Personal loan lenders typically issue loan funds within a few business days directly into your bank account. You can often complete the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">application process</a> online in less than 15 minutes.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower APRs may be available elsewhere:</strong> When financing a dental procedure, low-interest or no-interest promotional offers may be available to patients who can repay within a short timeframe. Secured options like a home equity line of credit also tend to carry lower APRs than personal loans, though you can lose your collateral if you can’t afford the loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>May be tough to qualify:</strong> It can be difficult to qualify for a favorable rate and term on a personal loan if you have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit</a> or a low income. You may have better luck with medical financing or no-credit-check options such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/401k-loan-vs-personal-loan\">401(k) loan</a> or emergency withdrawal.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Potential upfront fees:</strong> Some personal loan lenders charge an origination fee, which is typically deducted from the loan proceeds to reduce the lender’s risk.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Adds to your debt:</strong> Taking out a personal loan to pay for dental care increases your overall debt balance. Look into dental insurance coverage, payment plans, and assistance programs before taking on additional debt.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>When to consider a dental loan</h2><p>There are some situations when a dental loan makes a lot of sense and others when you may want to explore alternatives.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to consider</h3><ul><li><strong>To pay coinsurance / if you’ve maxed out your coverage:</strong>&nbsp;Even if you have dental insurance, many plans require you to cover 20% to 50% of procedure costs. Most also have an annual coverage cap — once you’ve reached it, you need to cover 100% of your dental care (minus preventative services) out of pocket.</li><li><strong>You don’t have access to lower or no-cost financing options:</strong>&nbsp;You should only consider a loan for dental work after you’ve considered other alternatives, such as no-interest dentist office payment plans. Just watch out for deferred interest promotions — if you don’t pay the entire bill before the promo period ends, you’ll owe interest on the original loan amount (even if you’ve already paid most of it off).</li><li><strong>You can’t otherwise afford a medically necessary procedure:</strong> Some dental procedures are critical and expensive, even if you have insurance. For example, “Root canals are often necessary to save a damaged tooth, but they can be expensive due to the complex nature of the procedure,” says Dr. Michael Wei, D.D.S., a cosmetic dentist and owner of Manhattan Cosmetic Dentist. In this situation, a personal loan is worth considering.</li><li><strong>Delaying treatment will cost you:</strong>&nbsp;“Some dental procedures require immediate attention to prevent further complications and potential pain. For example, if a patient is experiencing severe tooth pain or has a dental infection, waiting to seek treatment could result in the condition worsening and requiring more extensive and costly procedures in the future,” says Dr. Wei. If waiting will make matters worse, a dental loan could actually save you money in the long run.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312866":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312866","content":"<h3>When to avoid</h3><ul><li><strong>It’s a non-urgent or cosmetic procedure:</strong> If you’re looking to pay for teeth whitening, gum contouring, or another elective procedure, consider setting aside your income in a savings account instead of taking out a dental loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You’re eligible for assistance:</strong>&nbsp;Medicaid programs in 38 states plus D.C. offer dental coverage for adults, and all states are required to cover dental care for children.

Applying with a friend or family member who has good or excellent credit can help you get approved for a dental loan or get a lower APR.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider a secured dental loan:</strong> Some lenders offer secured personal loans, which are backed by an asset such as your car. The lender can take the asset if you fail to repay, which reduces the lender's risk of issuing a loan and might help you qualify with a lower credit score. You can find secured personal loans for dental work from online lenders like OneMain Financial and credit unions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freedomfirst.com/banking/personal-loans/secured-loans\">Freedom First</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How dental loans affect your credit</h2><p>There are a few ways a dental loan can impact your credit score:</p><ul><li>Applying for most loans requires a hard credit inquiry. This can cause a slight, temporary decline in your credit score, but for most people, the decrease is less than five points.&nbsp;</li><li>The new loan will also increase your existing debt, which could negatively impact your credit score initially.&nbsp;</li><li>It could add to your credit mix, which could positively impact your score.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>From there, the impact on your credit score depends on how you manage repayment.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your score will improve with on-time payments.</li><li>Late or missed payments may cause it to drop.&nbsp;</li><li>Making payments reduces the amount owed on your dental loan, which can increase your score.</li></ul><p>Payment history is the most important factor in calculating your credit score, so make sure to keep up with monthly payments.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to compare dental loans</h2><p>When researching loans for your dental procedure, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan amount:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure the lender offers the amount you need and doesn’t require a minimum borrowing amount that is too high.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Annual cost:</strong>&nbsp;Compare APRs between loan options. APR indicates the annual cost of the loan as a percentage of the loan amount, including the interest rate and any upfront fees.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Origination fee:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders charge an origination fee, which may be deducted from the loan proceeds and reduces the amount you receive for your procedure. If you have good credit, look for dental loans with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">no origination fee</a>.</li><li><strong>Repayment term, monthly payment, and total cost:&nbsp;</strong>Personal loan repayment terms typically range from one to seven years. The repayment term affects the monthly payment, which determines whether the loan fits your budget. But you should also consider the total cost of repayment over the life of the loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong>&nbsp;If you need an emergency root canal or another urgent dental procedure, narrow down your options to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day personal loans</a> so you can get your cash fast.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lender reputation:</strong>&nbsp;Check customer reviews on sites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a>, make sure the lender offers customer support options that meet your needs (live chat, phone, or in person), and check that the lender is licensed in your state.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How much do common dental procedures cost?</h2><p>Dental procedure costs vary by state, city, and dental provider. If you have dental insurance, the amount of coverage for each service and your copay or coinsurance will depend on the plan. The chart below shows the average nationwide cost of common dental procedures based on a 2023-2024 study conducted on behalf of CareCredit — expect costs to be higher now.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312834":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312834","content":"<p>In most cases, procedure pricing isn’t set in stone. “Hospitals and dentists often have flexible pricing if you ask, but most people don’t think to negotiate medical costs like they would a car or a house,” says Bola Sokunbi, author/founder and CEO of Clever Girl Finance. Before applying for a dental loan, come to an agreement with your dental provider on a price that you can afford.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other ways to finance dental care</h2><ul><li><strong>Medicaid or dental insurance:</strong> If you’re not eligible for Medicaid and don’t have dental coverage through your employer, consider buying private dental insurance, choosing an ACA (Affordable Care Act) plan with dental coverage, or adding a separate dental plan during open enrollment on the marketplace. There’s typically a waiting period for most services, so this won’t be an option if you need emergency dental care.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Assistance programs:</strong>&nbsp;Ask your dentist or research local nonprofit assistance programs if you can’t afford medically necessary dental care. “Some dental practices, including ours, have established nonprofit initiatives to give back to the community. Through these programs, a select number of patients each year receive significantly discounted treatment,” says Deborah Israeli, co-founder and office manager at Sage Dental NJ. Dr. Wei also notes that local charitable organizations sometimes offer grants or other assistance.</li><li><strong>Dental discount programs:</strong> Dental discount programs offer savings on a wide range of services at in-network dentists in exchange for a membership fee, which is typically more affordable than an insurance premium. These programs can leave you with high out-of-pocket costs for expensive services, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>HSA/FSA accounts:</strong>&nbsp;Health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts are tax-advantaged accounts you use to pay for medical expenses. If you contribute to one of these accounts, you can use the money to pay for dental care.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Medical credit card:</strong>&nbsp;A medical credit card is designed to be used for medical and wellness expenses such as dental care. Some medical credit cards, like CareCredit, offer the advantage of promotional financing on purchases above a spending threshold. These offers can be beneficial — but only if you can repay the full balance within the promotional period. However, medical credit cards are restrictive compared to personal loans.</li><li><strong>Dental clinic financing:</strong> Your dental provider may offer an interest-free payment plan (not a loan) or financing through a partner lender (which is a loan). You can prequalify to see if you’re eligible, but make sure to compare your dental clinic’s financing offer with a few personal loan lenders, and watch out for deferred interest financing.</li><li><strong>0% APR credit card:</strong> If you have good credit, consider applying for a new credit card with a zero-interest promotional period (and check your existing cards for offers). For example, the U.S. Bank Shield Visa Card allows new cardholders to avoid interest on new purchases for up to 24 billing cycles, provided they keep up with the minimum payments. Just note that a credit card's standard APR goes into effect after the 0% APR offer expires.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best dental loans and rates for a wide range of credit and income profiles.

These loans help pay for your current tuition and other expenses, but schools can also use up to $200 toward past-year expenses, according to the <a href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2024-2025/2024-2025_Federal_Student_Aid_Handbook/_knowledge-center_fsa-handbook_2024-2025_vol4.pdf\">Federal Student Aid (FSA) Handbook</a>.

If you're a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/independent-vs-dependent-status\">dependent student</a>, you'll submit the required information for yourself and your parents. The FAFSA is usually due on June 30 every year, but you have until early September to make corrections or updates.</p><p>Some states and schools have their own deadlines. Double-check with your school's financial aid office to find out if there are any other deadlines. The sooner you submit the FAFSA, the better — especially since some aid is given on a first-come, first-served basis.</p><h3>Apply for emergency loans or grants</h3><p>Some colleges have emergency funding options available to help students cover tuition and non-tuition-related expenses. These are typically small amounts of $500 to $1,000. Reach out to your financial aid office to see if there are resources that can help. Generally, emergency funding is available to students who are experiencing a change in circumstances or financial hardship.</p><p>You can also look at different nonprofits and organizations that provide emergency funding assistance.

Take out a private student loan</h2><p>If you've explored all other options and still need to cover college costs, private student loans can help bridge the gap.

They typically let you borrow as much as the total cost of attendance at your school, and many lenders provide quick approval and funding.</p><p>On the downside, qualifying for a private student loan can be more challenging because lenders look at your credit score and income. As an undergraduate, you might not have established credit — or any credit history — making it harder to qualify on your own. That's why many students <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">apply with a cosigner</a>.

These accounts offer tax advantages for families who set aside money specifically for education expenses. Contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses like tuition, fees, books, and room and board.</p><p>You can open a 529 plan through your state or a financial institution. In some cases, your state may even offer a tax deduction or credit for contributing to its plan.</p><h3>Scholarships and grants</h3><p>In addition to savings, you can reduce your college costs by applying for financial aid. The most valuable type is free aid, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>. Federal grants are available through programs like the Pell Grant, while colleges and private organizations may offer additional scholarships or need-based awards.</p><h3>Part-time work</h3><p>While many students <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">work during college</a> to help pay for tuition, Kantrowitz advises limiting your work hours, if possible. While it sounds counterproductive to lower your earnings during your college years, Kantrowitz notes that students who work full-time are less likely to graduate compared to those who work 12 hours or less.</p><p>Another option is the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study</a> program. This form of financial aid allows eligible students to earn money through part-time jobs while in school. Work-study is typically reserved for students with financial need, and the money earned doesn't have to be repaid.</p><h3>Tuition reimbursement programs</h3><p>If you're already in the workforce, check whether your employer offers a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">tuition reimbursement program</a>. Some companies provide tax-free benefits to help cover the cost of tuition, books, and other school-related expenses, and in some cases, even student loan repayment.</p><p>Under IRS rules, employer-paid educational assistance is tax-free up to $5,250 per employee per year. That limit applies to both tuition and student loan repayment benefits combined. Any amount above that becomes taxable.</p><h3>Student loans</h3><p>Another common way to pay for college is with student loans. The federal government offers two main types: <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">subsidized and unsubsidized loans</a>. Subsidized loans are for students with financial need, and they don't accrue interest while you're in school, which can help keep your total costs lower. Unsubsidized loans start accruing interest right away, but they're one of the most accessible forms of student aid.</p><p>If federal loans don't fully cover your expenses, you can also apply for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> through banks, credit unions, or online lenders. These loans are based on your credit score and income, and they often come with higher interest rates, especially if you don't have strong credit.</p><p>Most undergraduates need a cosigner to qualify for a private loan.

You’ll need to determine what you can comfortably afford for both your monthly and down payment.</li><li><strong>Check your credit: </strong>Your credit will play a role in what loans you qualify for and the interest rate you receive, so pull your credit and assess where you stand.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved:</strong> You should always <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">get pre-approved</a>, as it can point you in the right direction price-wise.</li><li><strong>Compare mortgage rates:</strong> Next, compare your loan options. Look at interest rates, closing costs, and fees. You should also factor in the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/apr-vs-interest-rate\">mortgage APR</a>, too. The annual percentage rate indicates how much you’ll pay every year for the loan, including fees and other charges.</li><li><strong>Negotiate your home purchase: </strong>Include your pre-approval letters in any offer you make, and work with your agent to negotiate a deal. Showing sellers that you’re already pre-approved can often improve your chances — especially in a bidding war.</li><li><strong>Complete your mortgage application:</strong> Once you’ve chosen a lender and the seller has accepted your offer to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cost-to-buy-house\">buy the house</a>, it’s time to fill out the full loan application. This will require some financial information, a credit check, and documents like bank statements, tax returns, and W-2s.</li><li><strong>Get approved: </strong>After your application is in, it will go into underwriting, where your lender will verify all your information and crunch the numbers. They will also order an appraisal to make sure the home you’re buying is worth the borrowing amount.</li><li><strong>Prep for closing: </strong>Your lender will assign you a closing date. Be sure to secure a homeowners insurance policy on the home before this date arrives. You’ll need proof of coverage before closing the loan. You should also review your closing disclosures to understand the final costs and terms of your loan. If you have any questions, ask your loan officer ASAP.</li><li><strong>Close on your mortgage: </strong>Once the closing day arrives, you’ll sign your paperwork, pay your down payment and closing costs, and get your keys.</li></ol><p>Be sure to lean on your real estate agent and loan officer if you need help. They can guide you during the homebuying and mortgage processes and make sure you’re on track for success.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:14654":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"14654","content":"<h2>Monthly payments for different mortgage amounts</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:62614":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"62614","content":"<h2>Mortgage calculators&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">Mortgage Payment Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">Home Affordability Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/loan-to-value-calculator\">Loan-to-value (LTV) Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/piti-mortgage-calculator\">PITI Mortgage Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-can-i-borrow\">Borrowing Power Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-prequalification\">Mortgage Pre-qualification Calculator</a><br>&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319282","content":"<p>Cash advance apps, also called loan apps, make it easy to get small short-term loans, fast, regardless of your credit score.

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline.

The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

This program helps you eliminate a portion of your federal student loan debt, but there are certain requirements you must meet.</p><p>“You would need to be employed full-time at a qualifying organization,” D'Andrea explains. “You could also qualify if you work part-time at more than one job, if you work at least 30 hours [per week].”</p><p>“You must make payments on an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">income-driven repayment plan</a> for 120 months,” he adds. “Once you have reached all of these qualifying reasons, you can apply for PSLF.

Anyone enrolled in the SAVE, PAYE, or ICR plans will be transitioned to RAP by July 1, 2028.</p><h3>Income-driven repayment forgiveness</h3><p>You can also qualify for income-driven repayment forgiveness if you repay your federal student loans with an income-driven plan. These plans base your monthly payments on a percentage of your discretionary income, ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the plan.

As you work toward eliminating your student loans, there are a few ways you can reduce the burden your loans present. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Choosing an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan:</strong> If you have federal student loans, these plans are available and reduce the amount you pay each month to between 5% and 20% of your discretionary income. Participating in an IDR plan is critical to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, but you may want to choose this option even if you aren't pursuing PSLF because it can lead to loan forgiveness after your repayment term.</li><li><strong>Budgeting for loan payments: </strong>While you're fulfilling your service commitment to qualify for forgiveness, you still need to make on-time payments. Work your budget around the monthly amount you owe so you don't risk being late or defaulting, which could affect eligibility for forgiveness.</li><li><strong>Keep your documentation organized: </strong>You want to be able to prove eligibility for your forgiveness program, so keep careful records of your employment and your payments.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301814":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301814","content":"<p>Getting a loan with fair credit can be difficult, especially if you don’t know where to look.

This fee is accounted for in the APR, but it typically reduces the amount of money you receive since it's subtracted upfront from the loan funds.

Also, look for late payment and other lender fees.</li><li><strong>Look for discounts:</strong> Some lenders offer rate discounts for autopay or if you direct the lender to pay off your creditors directly (if you're using the loan to consolidate credit card debt or other debt).</li><li><strong>Compare repayment terms:</strong> Choose a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment term</a> that balances manageable monthly payments with the overall interest cost.

If not, your application could be denied — which could be a problem if the lender conducted a hard credit check when you applied (and most do). That's because hard credit checks can drag your score down by a few points, which isn't great when you already have fair credit. A score that's a few points lower could mean the difference between getting a loan and not.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid this and get a loan as easily and quickly as possible, take the following steps.&nbsp;</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li><strong>Check your credit score:</strong> Know where you stand before applying. This will help you eliminate lenders who require a higher credit score than yours.

You can also see whether you're likely to be charged an origination fee, how much each lender might approve you for, and available repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Gather documents:</strong> When you apply for a personal loan, you may need to provide proof of income, identity, and employment with paystubs or tax returns and a government ID.</li><li><strong>Consider a cosigner or applying with a co-applicant:</strong> Either could help you get approved for a loan or lower your rate. The lender considers both your financial criteria and theirs when making a lending decision. Note that a cosigner doesn't share in the loan proceeds, while a co-applicant does. Few lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loans with cosigners</a>, but many more offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\">joint personal loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Consider a secured loan:</strong> You might improve your chances of qualifying for a loan or getting a lower interest rate if you offer collateral.

Here's how:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce credit card balances:</strong> By reducing your credit utilization (the percentage of available credit you use), you can make meaningful improvements to your credit score within one month. One way is to pay off new charges every month. Another is to use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation loan</a> to pay off your credit cards. It might seem counterintuitive to get one loan to improve your chances of getting another, but if you carry high balances (especially if you can get an equal or lower interest rate with a debt consolidation loan), it could be worthwhile</li><li><strong>Increase your credit limit:</strong> This tip is along the same lines as the previous one. If your existing creditors are willing to increase your credit limits, you can reduce your credit utilization — which can quickly boost your score. Another way to do this is to become an authorized user on a family member's or good friend's credit card. Just be sure they maintain a low or no balance and have good credit (otherwise, this tactic can backfire).</li><li><strong>Pay bills on time:</strong> This is an essential practice for getting and maintaining good credit. Start now, since it can take a positive payment history of several months to see results.</li><li><strong>Avoid new hard credit inquiries:</strong> Don't apply for credit just to see if you can get approved. That costs you points off your credit score. Whenever you apply for a loan, do so with the intention of getting the loan to improve your situation.</li><li><strong>Check your credit report:</strong> Scour your report for errors and dispute any with the appropriate bureau. To view your free credit report from each bureau, visit <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Secured credit card:</strong> A secured credit card can help you build credit while giving you a small line of credit based on an initial deposit amount.

Do the same for exterior walls if you’re painting the outside, as they measure differently. You might be able to find the exterior perimeter on your mortgage closing papers.</li><li><strong>Find the paintable area. </strong>Measure the total square footage of the windows and doors, and subtract that area from the total finished area. A standard door measures 21 square feet, while a standard window measures 12 square feet.</li><li><strong>Find the coverage area of the paint.</strong> A gallon of paint covers about 400 square feet on average, though you may need more for rough exterior siding. Exteriors usually need two coats of paint, and interiors may need two or three coats if you’re making a dramatic color change.</li><li><strong>Choose your paint.</strong> The cost of a gallon of paint depends on the brand, color, sheen, regional pricing, and whether you’re using interior or exterior paint.</li><li><strong>Do the math.</strong> Divide the paintable area by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons of paint you need. Then, multiply the number of gallons by the price of the gallon to complete your estimate.</li><li><strong>Use this formula.</strong> To find the number of gallons you need, use this formula: square feet of paintable area / square feet of paint coverage area = gallons of paint x 2 = total gallons of paint needed (rounded up to the nearest gallon)</li></ul><h3>Example calculation</h3><p>Let’s say you’re painting three rooms — two bedrooms and a living room:</p><ol><li>The main bedroom is 200 square feet</li><li>The second bedroom is 150 square feet</li><li>The living room is 300 square feet</li></ol><p>This comes out to a total finished area of 650 square feet. There are also three doors and five windows within those three rooms, for a total area of 123 square feet, giving you a paintable area of 527 square feet.

After that, you’ll have to pay the remaining principal balance at once.</p><p>Here’s how that happens. With a balloon mortgage, the term is far shorter than the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-amortization\">amortization period</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Term:</strong>&nbsp;The number of years the borrower has to repay the loan.</li><li><strong>Amortization period:</strong>&nbsp;The number of years over which <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">the loan’s payment is calculated</a>.</li></ul><p>For example, the popular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates/30-year-fixed\">30-year fixed-rate mortgage</a>&nbsp;has a 30-year term and a 30-year amortization period. You make the same payment every month for 30 years (360 months), and then you’ve completely paid off your loan.</p><p>A balloon mortgage, by comparison, might have a five-year term and a 30-year amortization. You’ll make the same payment every month for five years (60 months) that you would have made on the loan with the 30-year term. But after that, you’ll owe all of the remaining principal.</p><p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong>&nbsp;The term for a balloon mortgage doesn’t have to be five years. It could be seven years, 10 years, 15 years, or whatever the lender is willing to offer.</p><h2>How do balloon mortgages work?</h2><p>Balloon mortgages allow you to make lower monthly payments than what would normally be allowed with other types of mortgages. In exchange, you have to repay the full amount borrowed sooner than you would with, say, a conventional mortgage.</p><p>The most common type of mortgage — a 30-year fixed-rate home loan — gives you three decades to repay the principal. By comparison, a balloon mortgage might require you to pay off the principal after five years. During the five years that you carry the mortgage, you might pay only interest, or interest plus a small amount of principal — it just depends on the type of balloon mortgage you take out.</p><p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Many people repay the balance by selling or refinancing their home. Ultimately, you’ll need to find a way to make the large balloon payment so you don’t default on the loan, ruin your credit score, and potentially lose your real estate.</p><h2>Balloon payment schedule</h2><p>Lenders offer different ways to structure a balloon mortgage and different term lengths. One possibility might require you to pay both interest and principal each month for five years, followed by a large balloon payment at the end of the term.</p><p>The chart below (an amortization schedule) shows what these payments would look like on a $300,000 loan with an interest rate of 1.8% structured as a 30/5 balloon mortgage.</p><p>A 30/5 structure means the lender calculates your monthly payments as if you’ll be repaying the loan for 30 years, but you actually only make those payments for five years. At the end of the five-year (60-month) term, you’ll repay the remaining principal, or $260,534.53, as a lump sum.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15786":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15786","content":"<h2>How balloon mortgages compare to other home loans</h2><p>Here’s what your payments would look like through the first five years on a $300,000 home loan structured in different ways.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15790":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15790","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>You’ll enjoy a lower interest rate:</strong>&nbsp;A lower interest rate can save you money in the short run. Using the numbers from the loan comparison table in the previous section, you’d pay $64,746 over the first five years of the balloon loan, $73,483 over the first five years of the ARM, and $75,889 over the first five years of the 30-year fixed-rate conventional loan.</li><li><strong>The monthly payments are smaller:</strong>&nbsp;You can more easily fit a smaller monthly payment into a tight budget. Smaller monthly payments can also help with cash flow in lean months if you’re a business owner whose monthly income fluctuates.</li><li><strong>It’s an alternative to conventional financing:</strong>&nbsp;A balloon mortgage may be an option for certain borrowers who don’t qualify for conventional financing. This doesn’t mean a balloon mortgage is a good idea if your finances are unstable. It means it might be an option if your financial profile doesn’t fit the types of borrowers that mainstream mortgages are designed for.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Refinancing might not be possible:&nbsp;</strong>Your income could be lower or your property’s value might have sunk by the time you want to&nbsp;refinance. Interest rates could also be a lot higher than they are now, making your new payment unaffordable. Even if you can refinance, you’ll have to pay closing costs, which might negate your interest rate savings.</li><li><strong>Selling might be difficult:&nbsp;</strong>Demand for homes in your area might not be there. A natural disaster, zoning change, or loss of a major employer could make your property less desirable. You might not be able to sell for enough money to pay off your loan, let alone get your equity out.</li><li><strong>You could lose your home:&nbsp;</strong>If you can’t make the balloon payment, you can’t refinance, and you can’t sell, there’s a good chance your loan will go into&nbsp;foreclosure. It’s possible the lender could agree to a loan modification, but don’t count on it.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to get out of a balloon mortgage</h2><p>A balloon mortgage requires you to make a lump sum payment of principal at the end of your loan term. If you don’t want to come up with that kind of cash — or you have it but don’t want to spend it — here are three options.</p><h3>Sell your home</h3><p>If your local real estate market is strong enough, you may be able to sell your home before the final payment is due and use the proceeds to pay off the loan.</p><p>You’ll need to net enough from the sale after real estate commissions and other selling costs to cover the balance you owe.</p><p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong>&nbsp;For home purchases involving a mortgage, closing can take up to two months. Make sure you give yourself enough time to list your home and find a buyer to meet your balloon payment deadline.</p><h3>Refinance your home</h3><p>If your income and credit are strong enough, and current interest rates are affordable, you may be able to refinance your balloon loan.</p><p>As with any mortgage refinance, your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio will be important. You’ll typically need an LTV of 80% or lower to refinance your home. For example, if you owe $250,000 on your mortgage, your home will need to be worth at least $312,500 to qualify with many lenders.</p><h3>Pay down the principal faster</h3><p>If you’re not interested in selling or refinancing the property but want to keep it, the only way to get out of your balloon loan will be to pay it off. This might mean paying several thousand dollars a month throughout your loan term — far more than the minimum.</p><p>Other possibilities include coming up with the lump sum from a savings or brokerage account, a retirement account, or by selling another asset. Consult a financial advisor before choosing one of these options because of their potential long-term consequences.</p><h2>Alternatives to a balloon mortgage</h2><p>If you’re tempted by a balloon mortgage but put off by the disadvantages, consider these alternatives.</p><h3>Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</h3><ul><li><strong>Best for:</strong>&nbsp;Low interest rates with no balloon payment</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/adjustable-rate-mortgage\">Adjustable-rate mortgages</a>&nbsp;often have lower rates than 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. On top of that, an ARM with a 30-year term can have the lowest monthly payments available outside of a balloon mortgage.</p><p>However, the interest rate does reset after the initial fixed period, so these loans still carry some risk. For instance, you might have a low rate for five years, then see annual rate adjustments for the next 25 years.</p><p>These annual adjustments are far less risky than owing a balloon payment, though, especially since there are limits on how high an ARM’s rate can adjust.</p><p><strong>Learn More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/arm-vs-fixed\">ARM vs. Fixed Mortgage: How To Choose Between Them</a></p><h3>30-year fixed mortgage</h3><ul><li><strong>Best for:</strong>&nbsp;Stability with low monthly payments</li></ul><p>A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage may not be much more expensive than an ARM. For a slightly higher interest rate, you get the security of knowing that your monthly mortgage payment will be exactly the same for the next 30 years.</p><p>The stability of the repayment schedule is one reason why both 30-year fixed and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates/15-year-fixed\">15-year fixed mortgages</a>&nbsp;are so popular.</p><h3>Bank statement mortgage</h3><ul><li><strong>Best for:</strong>&nbsp;Certain self-employed borrowers</li></ul><p>Contrary to what you might have heard,&nbsp;self-employed borrowers&nbsp;can qualify for conventional loans. But sometimes, taking all those business deductions means your income looks too low to repay a mortgage, even though you have plenty of income.</p><p>That’s where a bank statement mortgage (also known as&nbsp;“<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/no-doc-loans\">no-doc loans</a>”) can be helpful because it places more emphasis on your liquid assets.

With only a soft credit check, you can prequalify with lenders and get an idea of the rates and terms you might qualify for. Prequalification provides estimates but isn't an offer of credit.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\"><strong>Compare your options</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Consider factors such as APR, loan term, loan amount, and even customer service when narrowing down your options.</li><li><strong>Apply online or in person:</strong>&nbsp;You can usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply for a personal loan online</a>. You’ll need to have some documentation handy, including proof of income and proof of residence. If you’d prefer, you can apply in person at a local bank or credit union.</li><li><strong>Wait for approval:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders may offer approval within minutes, but others may take longer. If your credit report is frozen, you’ll need to temporarily unfreeze it so the lender can pull your credit.</li><li><strong>Agree to the loan terms:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re approved, review the loan terms carefully, including repayment terms, fees, and interest rate. Sign the loan agreement if everything looks right, and make sure the lender has your bank account info to direct deposit the funds.</li><li><strong>Make plans for repayment:</strong>&nbsp;As soon as your loan account is created, log in to set up automatic payments. (Pro tip: Many lenders offer a small rate discount if you enroll in autopay.) Set calendar reminders so you can always make sure your bank account has enough funds to clear the day before your scheduled payment.</li></ol><h2>How to compare veteran loans</h2><p>When comparing personal loans as a veteran, you’ll want to consider a few key factors:</p><h3>Eligibility requirements</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Eligibility requirements</a> for personal loans vary by lender. Each lender generally sets a minimum credit score, as well as requirements for income, employment, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a>. Some lenders may only be available in select states.</p><p>With military-focused banks or credit unions, additional requirements can include:</p><ul><li>Military status (active-duty or retired)</li><li>Civilian employment with the Department of Defense</li><li>Family member of active-duty military or veteran</li></ul><h3>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h3><p>Often, borrowers think they should compare interest rates or conflate the term “interest rate” with “annual percentage rate.” But the <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">annual percentage rate</a> (APR) is actually different from the interest rate and is a better way to measure the cost of borrowing.</p><p>APR refers to the interest rate&nbsp;and any upfront fees (such as an <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>). Thus, the APR is a better indicator of the cost of the loan on an annual basis. Ideally, you want to choose the&nbsp;personal loan with the lowest APR and a short repayment term to save the most money on interest.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan amounts</h3><p>Loan amounts for veterans vary by lender and purpose, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Navy Federal:</strong> $250 to $50,000 for general-purpose loans, up to $150,000 for home improvement loans</li><li><strong>USAA:</strong> $2,500 to $100,000</li></ul><p>Loan amounts from commercial lenders and traditional banks typically range from $1,000 to $50,000. However, some banks offer small-dollar loans to existing customers, such as Bank of America's Balance Assist loans (up to $500). A few lenders offer personal loans up to $100,000, and BHG Financial's maximum loan amount is $250,000.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">How Much of a Personal Loan Can I Get?</a></p><h3>Repayment terms</h3><p>Typically, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">personal loan repayment terms</a> run from two to seven years. On the extreme end, you can find loan terms as long as 10 or even 20 years (typically for home improvement loans).</p><p>The longer the loan term, the lower your monthly payment will be — but bear in mind that this extends the length of time you’re paying interest, which makes the loan more expensive. Prioritize the loan with the shortest repayment term whose monthly payments you can still reasonably afford.</p><h3>Funding speed</h3><p>Some lenders offer same-day approval and same-day funding, meaning you could have your loan funded the same day you apply. Others may take a few business days for either phase (approval and funding), especially if you’re working with a brick-and-mortar institution.</p><p>If you need money immediately, it may be worth choosing a lender offering&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day funding</a>, even if the APR is slightly higher. If you can wait a few days, prioritize the loan with the lowest rate.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:304082":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"304082","content":"<h2>What are the requirements for a veteran personal loan?</h2><p>Eligibility requirements for personal loans vary by lender, but in general, lenders have the following requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;Generally, borrowers must be 18 or older to take out a personal loan, but it may be higher in some states.</li><li><strong>State:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders may not offer personal loans in all 50 states.</li><li><strong>Credit score:</strong>&nbsp;Most lenders require a credit score of 640 or higher, but there are some lenders that may offer personal loans to borrowers with a score as low as 540. Some secured personal loans are available to <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-history-loans\">borrowers with no credit history</a> at all. You may also improve your chances of getting a personal loan by adding a more qualified cosigner, such as a close family member.</li><li><strong>Income and employment:</strong>&nbsp;Lenders typically want borrowers to have steady employment (or another source of income). That income also needs to be high enough to reasonably manage monthly payments. One way to measure this is a borrower’s debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. A high DTI means you have a lot of monthly debt obligations relative to your monthly income and thus may not be able to afford a personal loan payment.</li><li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> If you’re getting a loan through a credit union or bank that works exclusively with military members and their families, you may need to show proof of your military affiliation.</li></ul><h2>Active-duty servicemember borrowing protections</h2><p>Federal laws offer veterans a measure of protection in certain financial matters, including loans, as well as certain legal matters that involve finances.</p><h3>Military Lending Act</h3><p>The Military Lending Act (MLA) is a law enacted in 2006 that offers multiple protections for active-duty servicemembers — and their spouses and dependents — when taking out a loan.</p><p>Primarily, the MLA caps the annual percentage rate (interest rate and fees) at 36% on any loan provided to a qualifying member of the military. While this is a helpful limit, it may not make a difference when taking out a personal loan as a member of the military.&nbsp;</p><p>Lenders typically cap APRs at 36% on all personal loans, regardless of military status or credit score. Further, this protection is for active-duty servicemembers, not veterans.</p><p>The Military Lending Act does offer other protections, including:</p><ul><li>No prepayment penalties</li><li>No mandatory allotments</li><li>No mandatory waivers of certain legal rights</li></ul><h3>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</h3><p>The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act offers financial and legal protections to active-duty servicemembers (including Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Reserve, and National Guard. It also covers certain members of the Public Health Service (PHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) when they are serving in a manner similar to active duty. While not a protection for veterans, it is important to know if you are considering serving or are currently serving.</p><p>Chief among those protections is an interest rate reduction. Any existing loans a servicemember has when they become active duty — including student loans, credit cards, car loans, mortgage loans, medical bills, title loans, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loans</a> (such as personal loans) — are capped at a 6% interest rate during active duty.</p><p>In addition, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act offers protections against:</p><ul><li>Default judgments in civil cases (like if you’re sued while serving and are unable to appear in court)</li><li>Foreclosure on your home without a court order</li><li>Repossession of your property without a court order</li><li>Penalties for terminating housing and automobile lease agreements if orders are received for a permanent change of station or deployment for 90 days or more.</li></ul><h2>Other financial resources for veterans</h2><p>Personal loans can be a great financial tool for veterans, but there are additional resources that veterans can rely on after their service.</p><h3>Department of Veterans Affairs</h3><p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (commonly referred to as the VA) is the official government agency that offers financial assistance for servicemembers and veterans, including the GI Bill and other education benefits,&nbsp;<a href=\"/mortgage/va-loan-requirements\">VA home loans</a>, life insurance, disability compensation, support for a small business, pension benefits, and more.</p><p>You can also learn more about military benefits available to active duty servicemembers and veterans by visiting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/military-pay-benefits\">this guide on the official U.S. government website</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>National Veterans Foundation</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nvf.org/\">National Veterans Foundation</a> is a non-governmental organization that offers a helpline and outreach for veterans, including those in need of food, transportation, and clothing. The foundation can also help veterans seeking employment via a job board, as well as educate veterans about some of the financial resources available via the government, such as VA home loans.</p><h3>Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://saluteheroes.org/\">Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes</a> is a nonprofit organization designed to help veterans and their families in need of aid.

If you default on the loan, your lender can take your collateral.</li><li><strong>Unsecured loan:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\">Unsecured personal loans</a> can be acquired without any collateral. <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Lenders determine approval</a> based on factors such as your DTI (lenders typically prefer under 35%), credit history, and income. Because collateral isn’t required to secure the loan, these types of loans usually have slightly higher APRs if you don’t have a good credit score.</li><li><strong>Cosigned personal loans:</strong> A cosigner is someone who promises to repay the loan if you can't. Lenders may be more willing to approve your loan application or lower your rate if you apply with a cosigner with good credit. But if you make late payments or default, not only will your cosigner be on the hook for what you owe, but their credit could suffer.

These loans have sky-high APRs, which can be 400% or more, depending on where you live, and typically charge $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. They’re short-term, two- to four-week loans with maximum loan amounts up to $500, generally.</p><p>The problem with these loans is that they can be hard to pay off on time when you're already short on funds. This can lead you to renew or rollover the debt, which can then lead to more fees. <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> can end up being quite costly and should be avoided.</p><p>However, there are other options, like <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loans (PALs)</a>, which are offered by certain federal credit unions to their members as a legitimate alternative to payday loans. Loan amounts may be available up to $2,000, depending on the type of PAL, and APRs are capped at 28%. Even if you're not currently a credit union member, some offer PALs to new members as soon as they join.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to compare personal loans</h2><p>When you’re ready to borrow, prequalify for a personal loan with multiple lenders first. It won't impact your credit score and can help you compare loans before submitting an application.&nbsp;</p><p>However, prequalification is not an offer of credit, and your final rate could be different.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what to look for:</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong> When comparing <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rates</a>, lower is always better. However, instead of only comparing interest rates, compare the APR. Because APRs factor in upfront fees like origination fees, as well as the interest rate, using the APR as a benchmark will make it more of an apples-to-apples comparison between loans.</li><li><strong>Fees: </strong>Keep in mind, you may be charged fees (such as origination, application, or late fees), and this could add to your borrowing costs. Origination fees are usually a percentage of your loan amount taken out of the loan upfront. Other charges include late fees and, in some cases, a documentation fee.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> Your repayment term is the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">amount of time you have to repay your loan</a>. Shorter terms usually mean higher monthly payments, while longer terms can lower your payments (but increase your overall borrowing cost, due to interest). Consider how long you’d prefer to repay your loan, and keep in mind your budget while comparing options. It’s usually best to pick the loan with the lowest APR with a monthly payment you can comfortably afford.</li><li><strong>Time to fund:</strong> If you need money fast, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">how soon the lender can deliver it</a> is important. Many lenders fund personal loans within a few days of approval, and some offer same-day personal loans. If you need a personal loan for an emergency, it could be worth paying a slightly higher APR to get one.</li><li><strong>Perks:</strong> Did you know some lenders offer perks, too? You may score a better APR when choosing a lender with whom you already have a relationship. Or you might gain access to perks like free credit scores, hardship forbearance, or even job placement assistance if you find yourself out of work. Perks don’t always make up for high interest rates or other drawbacks, but they could be a deciding factor when comparing two similar loan options.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>How to apply for a personal loan</h2><p>To apply for a personal loan, follow these steps. You’ll want to have your financial information handy, along with your driver’s license and Social Security number, as many lenders require it.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll likely need to be over the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your state) and a lawful resident of the U.S. as well.</p><ol><li><strong>Check your credit:</strong> Before you begin loan shopping, check your credit report for an idea of what lenders will see when you apply. You’ll also want to correct any errors that could be dragging down your credit score.</li><li><strong>Know your existing debts:</strong> Lenders may want to know your debt-to-income ratio to get a feel for whether you can take on any more debt with your current budget.</li><li><strong>Check rate quotes:</strong> With this financial information in hand, shop around for rate quotes by prequalifying. This lets you know what interest rates and loan terms you might qualify for and where you're more likely to be approved.</li><li><strong>Fill out the application:</strong> When you find a lender that suits your needs, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">start the application</a>. Many lenders offer fully electronic applications, which can speed up the process (and you may get approved faster, too). Read over your answers carefully to make sure you’ve included all the required information. From here, the lender will perform a hard credit inquiry, which will lower your score temporarily.</li><li><strong>Upload documents:</strong> You may need to provide financial documents that show your income, assets, and debts, such as bank statements or pay stubs. Your lender will notify you of what documents you need and how to submit them.</li><li><strong>Receive funds and begin making payments:</strong> If you’re approved, you should receive your funds shortly after — sometimes as soon as the same or next business day. Once you receive the money, you can put it toward your bills or expenses. Don’t forget your monthly loan payments; you might even get a rate discount if you arranged for automatic payments from your bank account.</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:208118":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"208118","content":"<h3>What documents do I need to apply?</h3><p>The documents you'll need to submit with your application might vary between lenders but in general, be prepared to provide some or all of the following paperwork:</p><ul><li>Recent pay stubs</li><li>W-2</li><li>Most recent tax return</li><li>Copy of your driver's license</li><li>Copy of your Social Security card</li><li>Payoff letters from accounts you're paying off with your personal loan</li></ul>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:4998":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"4998","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"embedded-prequal","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:208122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"208122","content":"<h2>Personal loan alternatives</h2><p>As useful as personal loans can be, they’re not the right fit for everyone. Here are some alternatives that might work better for your situation.</p><ul><li><strong>Credit card:</strong> If you need a small amount of money for a short period of time, consider getting a credit card. Keep in mind, credit cards have relatively high interest rates (21.16%, on average, according to the Fed). <a href=\"https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26750745&amp;s1=&amp;utm_source=credible_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fhow-do-personal-loans-work\" data-sponsored=\"true\" rel=\"sponsored\">Credit cards</a> also have variable interest rates, which fluctuate based on market conditions. This means your rate can change, along with your monthly payment.</li><li><strong>Personal line of credit:</strong> Unlike a personal loan, but similar to a credit card, a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pros-and-cons-of-personal-line-of-credit\">personal line of credit</a> is a revolving account that lets you access your funds up to a certain limit. You may also have to pay a fee each time you access the account. Lines of credit are typically unsecured and come with variable interest rates as well. You can find personal lines of credit at banks or credit unions.</li><li><strong>Tap into your home equity:</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a> is a way to borrow against the value of your home. These kinds of loans can be used to cover big expenses like debt consolidation, home remodels, or college tuition, and usually have lower interest rates than credit cards, plus long repayment periods. Unlike a personal line of credit, both are secured by your home. If you default, you could face foreclosure.</li><li><strong>Cash-out refinance:</strong> Another way to use your home to get the cash you need is a <a href=\"/mortgage/cash-out-refinance-pros-and-cons\">cash-out refinance</a>. This is a way of refinancing your mortgage, plus an extra amount of cash you receive at closing that you can put toward your bills, purchases, or expenses. Keep in mind that this could extend the length of your mortgage and can change your interest rate, plus put you at risk of losing your home in the event of default.</li><li><strong>Payday alternative loans:</strong> As mentioned, these loans are a good fit for bad- or fair-credit borrowers.

For instance, you may have up to 90 days from your termination date to repay the loan in full.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, the unpaid amount becomes a plan distribution, which is taxable.

Removing money from your 401(k) without the intention of paying it back is a 401(k) withdrawal, also referred to as a distribution. These funds remain permanently removed from your account.&nbsp;</p><p>401(k) withdrawals are usually subject to a tax penalty of 10% if you’re under 59½ plus income tax. But there are exceptions. For example, you can take a 401(k) hardship withdrawal — a maximum of $1,000 — penalty-free once annually to pay for an emergency personal expense. Some plans also allow withdrawals for qualified birth, adoption, or medical expenses. Though you may avoid an early withdrawal penalty in these cases, your withdrawal would still be taxable according to your income tax rate.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does a 401(k) loan work?</h2><p>A 401(k) loan has specific rules on borrowing limits and repayments. Understanding the risks of borrowing against your 401(k) can help you decide if it’s a good option.</p><h3>Policies</h3><p>Most 401(k) policies differ between companies. “Some companies allow multiple loans at once, others cap borrowing at one loan at a time,” says Chris Heerlein, chief executive officer of REAP Financial. Your policy’s loan interest rate and repayment terms can vary from one employer to the next, too. Before borrowing, read your policy and ask your employer about restrictions on using your loan funds and what happens with your loan if you take a leave of absence or leave the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Borrowing limits</h3><p>The most you can borrow from a 401(k) plan is $50,000. But you can’t borrow this amount unless you have at least $100,000 vested in your account. This is because you're limited to borrow up to half of your vested balance. The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000. For example, if you only have $15,000 vested in your 401(k), you could borrow up to $10,000.&nbsp;</p><p>These borrowing limits are the same even if your 401(k) plan allows multiple loans at once.&nbsp;</p><p>Say you have a vested 401(k) balance of $60,000. Per the IRS, you’d be allowed to borrow up to $30,000, or 50% of your vested balance. (Keep in mind, your 401(k) plan would need to allow 401(k) loans.)&nbsp;</p><p>Let's also say that you already took out a loan for $20,000 and have repaid $10,000 of it (you still owe $10,000). Now, you want to borrow a second 401(k) loan. You’d be allowed to borrow up to $20,000, since half of your vested balance is $30,000, and the two loans would total $30,000.</p><h3>401(k) loan interest rate and fees</h3><p>Some 401(k) plans charge fees for your loan. This may be a one-time fee for establishing your loan, usually between $50 and $100. Some plan administrators may also charge a loan application fee and an annual maintenance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also pay interest on a 401(k) loan based on the current prime rate. However, the interest you pay goes back into your account. “Essentially, the interest payment is like moving money from your left pocket to your right pocket,” says Andrew Hall, certified financial planner, wealth advisor, and vice president of Farther, a wealth management platform.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267118":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267118","content":"<h3>Repayment&nbsp;</h3><p>Like other types of loans, you’ll repay a 401(k) loan over time with interest. Most plans require you to repay your loan in full within five years, although your repayment term may be extended if you’re using the funds to buy a home as your primary residence. You’ll also need to make payments at least once per quarter.&nbsp;</p><h3>Changing jobs</h3><p>If you leave your job when you have an outstanding 401(k) loan, you’ll need to repay the loan in full. This can happen if you quit or get terminated. If you can’t pay it off, your employer will treat it as a 401(k) withdrawal, meaning you’ll be taxed and charged the 10% distribution penalty if you’re under the age of 59½. For example, you may have up to 90 days after your termination date to pay back the outstanding balance in full.</p><h3>Retirement growth</h3><p>When you take out a 401(k) loan, the amount borrowed does not participate in market gains (or losses). “While you’re technically borrowing from yourself, the real cost is lost growth,” says Heerlein, who had a client take out a $30,000 401(k) loan and pay it back over five years. “The market performed well during that period, and had they left the money invested, it could have grown by tens of thousands. They repaid the loan, but the lost compounding set them back years.”</p><p>Plus, some plans may not allow you to contribute to your 401(k) while you have an outstanding loan. If this is the case and your plan includes employer-matching contributions, you could also lose out on thousands of dollars of “free” money (contributed by your employer) over the term of your 401(k) loan.&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, borrowing from your 401(k) can provide short-term financial relief but potentially leave you without as much of a retirement cushion later on.</p><h3>Credit impact&nbsp;</h3><p>A 401(k) loan doesn’t require a credit check, and neither the loan itself nor your payments will be reported to credit bureaus. Even if you don’t repay the loan, it won’t appear on your credit report. So, in terms of impacting your credit, a 401(k) loan carries little risk.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267122","content":"<h3>401(k) loans vs personal loans</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> doesn’t affect your retirement savings like a 401(k) loan.

Instead, you’re technically the lender, so any loan and interest payments go back into your 401(k). But if you switch jobs before paying off the loan, you’ll generally need to pay back the remainder to avoid taxes and early withdrawal penalties. For instance, you may have up to 90 days from your termination date to repay the loan in full. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Otherwise, the unpaid amount becomes a plan distribution, which is taxable. Plus, if you took out the loan before you turned 59½, you could owe a 10% early withdrawal penalty on any unpaid amount as well. </p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_tip__LuW2g"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="tip Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_tipImg__EX55M"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_tipTitle__RIk_D styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tip</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">A 401(k) withdrawal is also referred to as a “distribution.”</p></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">401(k) loan vs. 401(k) withdrawal</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A 401(k) loan is when you borrow money from your 401(k) with the intention of returning it, typically via regular payroll deductions. Removing money from your 401(k) without the intention of paying it back is a 401(k) withdrawal, also referred to as a distribution. These funds remain permanently removed from your account. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">401(k) withdrawals are usually subject to a tax penalty of 10% if you’re under 59½ plus income tax. But there are exceptions. For example, you can take a 401(k) hardship withdrawal — a maximum of $1,000 — penalty-free once annually to pay for an emergency personal expense. Some plans also allow withdrawals for qualified birth, adoption, or medical expenses. Though you may avoid an early withdrawal penalty in these cases, your withdrawal would still be taxable according to your income tax rate. </p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-does-a-(k)-loan-work">How does a 401(k) loan work?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A 401(k) loan has specific rules on borrowing limits and repayments. Understanding the risks of borrowing against your 401(k) can help you decide if it’s a good option.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Policies</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Most 401(k) policies differ between companies. “Some companies allow multiple loans at once, others cap borrowing at one loan at a time,” says Chris Heerlein, chief executive officer of REAP Financial. Your policy’s loan interest rate and repayment terms can vary from one employer to the next, too. Before borrowing, read your policy and ask your employer about restrictions on using your loan funds and what happens with your loan if you take a leave of absence or leave the company. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Borrowing limits</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The most you can borrow from a 401(k) plan is $50,000. But you can’t borrow this amount unless you have at least $100,000 vested in your account. This is because you&#x27;re limited to borrow up to half of your vested balance. The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000. For example, if you only have $15,000 vested in your 401(k), you could borrow up to $10,000. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">These borrowing limits are the same even if your 401(k) plan allows multiple loans at once. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Say you have a vested 401(k) balance of $60,000. Per the IRS, you’d be allowed to borrow up to $30,000, or 50% of your vested balance. (Keep in mind, your 401(k) plan would need to allow 401(k) loans.) </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Let&#x27;s also say that you already took out a loan for $20,000 and have repaid $10,000 of it (you still owe $10,000). Now, you want to borrow a second 401(k) loan. You’d be allowed to borrow up to $20,000, since half of your vested balance is $30,000, and the two loans would total $30,000.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">401(k) loan interest rate and fees</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some 401(k) plans charge fees for your loan. This may be a one-time fee for establishing your loan, usually between $50 and $100. Some plan administrators may also charge a loan application fee and an annual maintenance fee. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You’ll also pay interest on a 401(k) loan based on the current prime rate. However, the interest you pay goes back into your account. “Essentially, the interest payment is like moving money from your left pocket to your right pocket,” says Andrew Hall, certified financial planner, wealth advisor, and vice president of Farther, a wealth management platform.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_pin__z_PTM"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAgCAYAAAAbifjMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAD9SURBVHgB7ZQxTsMwFIb/P6YREksFF4jKRDZuULaOXTOVlgMgTgBchFbKCZhgI9ygA3SEHADRzFC/hz2UoaVScDvmW2w/+f/kwe8BW8L5qHOt4A3+T0mxp1Fg2JPYyPQjt6kQiFE73xPBMCIuFxaJCJM6wbilhZLPh+PynsvirHcyATmoI0gfZr+5CFvSCBrBTgT8uDjuUzGw3+yKsl0nFLfE9YJOj+7ervg56rw7T4IABK4RQ8NL/EC5RQiqUyO24Gr9pZeeu/kwXg+wSB9fz9ZesFoQagVFuYj3q6+DNvzqz/D1PyA2kOd51xjzRHKSZdlw073mKzeCnQh+AIFqUAFq25YWAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="pin Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_pinImg__6k6q1"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_pinTitle__dnoCL styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Good to know</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">The interest rate on a 401(k) is generally 1% to 2% plus the prime rate. The prime rate was 7.25% in late September 2025.</p></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment </h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Like other types of loans, you’ll repay a 401(k) loan over time with interest. Most plans require you to repay your loan in full within five years, although your repayment term may be extended if you’re using the funds to buy a home as your primary residence. You’ll also need to make payments at least once per quarter. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Changing jobs</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you leave your job when you have an outstanding 401(k) loan, you’ll need to repay the loan in full. This can happen if you quit or get terminated. If you can’t pay it off, your employer will treat it as a 401(k) withdrawal, meaning you’ll be taxed and charged the 10% distribution penalty if you’re under the age of 59½. For example, you may have up to 90 days after your termination date to pay back the outstanding balance in full.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Retirement growth</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When you take out a 401(k) loan, the amount borrowed does not participate in market gains (or losses). “While you’re technically borrowing from yourself, the real cost is lost growth,” says Heerlein, who had a client take out a $30,000 401(k) loan and pay it back over five years. “The market performed well during that period, and had they left the money invested, it could have grown by tens of thousands. They repaid the loan, but the lost compounding set them back years.”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Plus, some plans may not allow you to contribute to your 401(k) while you have an outstanding loan. If this is the case and your plan includes employer-matching contributions, you could also lose out on thousands of dollars of “free” money (contributed by your employer) over the term of your 401(k) loan. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For these reasons, borrowing from your 401(k) can provide short-term financial relief but potentially leave you without as much of a retirement cushion later on.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Credit impact </h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A 401(k) loan doesn’t require a credit check, and neither the loan itself nor your payments will be reported to credit bureaus. Even if you don’t repay the loan, it won’t appear on your credit report. So, in terms of impacting your credit, a 401(k) loan carries little risk.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_tip__LuW2g"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="tip Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_tipImg__EX55M"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_tipTitle__RIk_D styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tip</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">Because a 401(k) loan doesn’t appear on your credit report, it’s not generally included in your debt-to-income calculation (DTI), so it shouldn’t affect other loans or credit you apply for. </p></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">401(k) loans vs personal loans</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan</a> doesn’t affect your retirement savings like a 401(k) loan.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Specific criteria vary by loan type, but generally include interest rates, loan terms, eligibility requirements, transparency, funding times, repayment options, fees, discounts, customer service, cosigner options, and more.<br/><a class=" styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="lender-review-methodology.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read our full methodology.</a></p></div></p></div></div></div><div class="styles_bodyCell__47qT_ styles_noWrap__sQ8Xw"><p class="bodyLarge semiBold"><span>8.74%</span> <!-- -->-<!-- --> <span>35.49%</span> <sup class="styles_sup__I_s0h styles_superscript__RieCV" data-testid="apr-superscript" id="sofi-superscript"><a>1</a></sup></p></div><div class="styles_bodyCell__47qT_"><p class="bodyLarge semiBold">$5,000 - $100,000<!-- --> </p></div><div class="styles_bodyCell__47qT_"><p class="bodyLarge semiBold">Does not disclose<!-- --> </p></div><div class="styles_cellButtonContainer__Hzbhf"><a class="styles_cta__fD6_v bodySmall styles_specifierClass__MJfAg styles_cellButton__rA6Hv styles_primary__JLyZc styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb" href="../personal-loans/borrower/step/amount0966.html?preferred_lender=sofi-personal_pl&amp;utm_campaign&amp;utm_content&amp;utm_medium=cms-component-lender-table&amp;utm_source=credible_blog" rel="" target="_self">Apply</a><p class="disclaimer lighter">on Credible’s website</p><p class="styles_viewDetails__6X74k styles_viewDetails__jAp25 styles_disclaimer__B6kQy styles_secondary__pApUQ" tabindex="0">View Details<i class="styles_arrowIcon___OzKg cred-icon icon-chevron-down styles_body__wG6cR"></i></p></div></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_moreDetailsWrapper__pJYv2 styles_moreDetails__1Oc3Z"><div class="ReactCollapse--collapse" style="height:0px;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ReactCollapse--content"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_details__lQzii"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_overviewDetail__08UO5"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Overview</p><div><p>SoFi personal loans feature high loan amounts, competitive interest rates, as soon as same-day funding, and long loan terms, plus discounts for autopay and direct pay. Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

Plus, the company doesn’t conduct a hard credit check when you apply. That means, unlike most other personal loan lenders, your credit score won’t take a hit if you apply for a 60 Month Loan. It should be pointed out that the company offers a range of repayment terms, from one year to five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the maximum loan amount is low relative to other lenders, some of which offer loans up to $50,000 or more. And APRs start high, making the company a poor choice for applicants with good credit. Check your state for availability, as loans aren’t available nationwide.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Specific criteria vary by loan type, but generally include interest rates, loan terms, eligibility requirements, transparency, funding times, repayment options, fees, discounts, customer service, cosigner options, and more.<br/><a class=" styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="lender-review-methodology.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read our full methodology.</a></p></div></p></div></div></div><div class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_infoRow__xqA6L"><p class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_part__l7iS6 bodySmall semiBold lighter">Fixed (APR)</p><div class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_part__l7iS6"><p class="bold"><span>8.74%</span> <!-- -->-<!-- --> <span>35.49%</span><sup class="styles_sup__I_s0h" data-testid="apr-superscript" id="sofi-superscript"><a>1</a></sup></p></div></div><div class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_infoRow__xqA6L"><p class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_part__l7iS6 bodySmall semiBold lighter">Loan Amounts</p><div class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_part__l7iS6"><p class="bold">$5,000 - $100,000<sup class="styles_sup__I_s0h" data-testid="apr-superscript" id="sofi-superscript"><a>1</a></sup></p></div></div><div class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_infoRow__xqA6L"><p class="LenderTableFoxMobileView_part__l7iS6 bodySmall semiBold lighter">Min.

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Plus, the company doesn’t conduct a hard credit check when you apply. That means, unlike most other personal loan lenders, your credit score won’t take a hit if you apply for a 60 Month Loan. It should be pointed out that the company offers a range of repayment terms, from one year to five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the maximum loan amount is low relative to other lenders, some of which offer loans up to $50,000 or more. And APRs start high, making the company a poor choice for applicants with good credit.

A HELOC has a flexible draw period and a variable interest rate, which can work better for ongoing expenses or projects with uncertain costs. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Both options usually come with lower interest rates than unsecured personal loans and can be easier to qualify for.

These factors can closely influence your experience while working toward your degree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It's worth looking closely at class size, not just in broad averages but in how the classes are structured,” says Chanin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Almost every college will have larger introductory lectures, but the real question is: Are there opportunities to break those down into smaller discussion groups? Are there seminars, labs, or writing-intensive courses where students can work closely with faculty? That balance between breadth and intimacy says a lot about the academic culture,” she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLook at campus life and location\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe EAB survey revealed that first-time college students said location was the number one factor for choosing their school.

And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process.
