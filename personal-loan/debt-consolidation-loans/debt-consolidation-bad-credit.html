The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.  Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers. But Reprise is not for everyone.

Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate. Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline. How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility. For example, an app may require that you've received a certain amount of direct deposits into your bank account, a history of on-time cash advance payments, or a certain number of consecutive deposits.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319314":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319314","content":"<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</a></p><h3>Funding time</h3><p>Most cash advance apps have two options for funding: free and paid. The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee. Chime only charges $2 for instant delivery, and transfers within 24 hours are free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advances can be helpful if you're in a tight financial spot, they aren't meant to be something you continually rely on to cover your expenses, said Dr. Severine Bryan, founder of financial education and coaching company Sev Talks Money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319326","content":"<p>If you need to borrow money but don't want to use cash advance apps, you have several other options.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs.

Late payments count against you and stay on your record for 7 years.</li><li><strong>Keep credit utilization low</strong>: If you have revolving credit lines like credit cards, keep the balances as low as possible. Aim for no greater than 30% credit utilization. Credit utilization is a component of the “amounts owed” factor, which makes up 30% of your credit score.</li><li><strong>Limit new credit</strong>: Be mindful about the credit accounts you open, as they typically require hard credit inquiries and shorten your average credit account age, both of which can hurt your score. New credit and length of credit history contribute 10% and 15% to your score, respectively.</li><li><strong>Add bills to your credit report:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/credit/score-boost/\">Experian Boost</a> is one example of a free program that lets you add bills and rent payments to your Experian credit report. You can self-report rent payments for free to all 3 credit bureaus with a service like <a href=\"https://www.self.inc/\">Self</a>. Research these and other rent- and bill-reporting services to find the best for you.</li><li><strong>Check for drop-off dates</strong>: If you have negative marks, check the dates they'll drop off your reports. Most items only stay on credit reports for 7 years. If negative marks are going to drop off soon, score improvements will likely follow.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If you have a close friend or family member willing to make you an authorized user on their credit card, you could see a boost in your own score within a month — as long as they make on-time monthly payments and maintain a low or zero balance. High balances and late payment activity on their part could impact your credit report and score.</li></ul><p>Camberato recommends you start by trying to figure out what's pulling your score down. “Is it high balances, missed payments, or something else? This will give you a clear starting point.” He adds that you often can't improve your credit score overnight, but if you stick with it, you'll see real progress over time.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:283454":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"283454","content":"<p><i><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Some lending partners that participate in Credible’s comparison marketplace offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 550.

Emergency home or car repairs</h2><p>Some emergencies need to be addressed right away to prevent further damage to your property and pocketbook — like if a pipe bursts in your home, or you run into trouble with your car’s engine.</p><p>You could take out an <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency personal loan</a> and possibly get funding as soon as the same or next business day after approval. If you need around $500 or less, consider a cash advance app — just check express funding fees. This is where these apps can get expensive.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Emergency vet expenses</h2><p>An unexpected vet bill for your animal companion can be pricey. An emergency vet visit could cost up to $3,000 for a cat and up to $5,000 for a dog, according to pet insurance provider <a href=\"https://www.metlifepetinsurance.com/blog/pet-health/emergency-vet-cost/\">MetLife</a>. If you can’t pay for this expense out of pocket or your pet insurance doesn’t cover it, you may look into a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pet-loans\">pet loan</a>. If you're struggling to cover any upfront costs, such as for the office visit (aside from emergency pet surgery, etc.), consider a cash advance app for near-instant money.&nbsp;</p><p>For a loan large enough to cover the bulk of your pet's vet bills, look to a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a>. You can spread costs out over several years to keep them affordable, if necessary, and rates are much lower than credit card annual percentage rates (APRs), on average. Some lenders can send money the same day you apply, and some even offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/pet-loans\">pet loans for bad credit</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Life events</h2><p>If you experience a life event like <a href=\"/personal-loan/loans-for-unemployed\">losing your job</a>, you may consider taking out an emergency loan to cover your bills until you find another one. Or, you may need to borrow money to pay bills if you’re <a href=\"/personal-loan/self-employed-loans\">self-employed</a> and your income suffers a major drop.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be more difficult to <a href=\"/personal-loan/low-income-loan\">qualify for a low income loan</a>.

Debt consolidation</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">Debt consolidation</a> involves combining your debt into a new loan, such as a personal loan, with a single monthly payment. You can use consolidation to make repaying debt more manageable or lower your overall interest rate.</p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-does-debt-consolidation-work\">Consolidating your debt</a> might not be a typical emergency — unless you've realized you can't continue to afford your current debt payments or will have to make some big sacrifices to do so. For example, if you have overwhelming <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/how-much-credit-card-debt-too-much\">credit card debt</a> that is eating into your savings, you may be able to <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/pay-off-credit-card-debt\">pay down the balance</a> with a debt consolidation loan and get a lower monthly payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on your credit profile, you may be able to get a lower interest rate than on your credit cards as well. The average rate for a 24-month personal loan was 11.57% in May 2025, compared to 21.16% for credit cards, according to the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve</a>.</p><p><strong>Check Out:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-personal-loan\">Debt Consolidation vs. Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:232998":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"232998","content":"<h2>5.

Moving expenses</h2><p>Moving expenses can set you back thousands of dollars, whether relocating for a job or another reason. The average cost for a local move is $1,250, while long-distance moves can cost around $5,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.moving.com/movers/moving-cost-calculator.asp\">Moving.com</a>. If you don’t have money saved up for the move, a <a href=\"/personal-loan/moving-loans\">moving loan</a> can help.</p><h2>7. Large essential purchases</h2><p>An emergency loan can also help you cover large and expensive repairs. For example, you may need to take out one if your refrigerator or washing machine breaks down and it’s beyond repair.</p><h2>Types of emergency loans</h2><p>Several types of emergency loans exist, including:</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p>A personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan you can get from a bank, credit union, or online lender. They are usually unsecured, meaning you don’t have to pledge collateral to qualify. <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">Loan amounts</a> can range from $600 to $100,000 or more, depending on the lender, with typical <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> of 1 to 7 years. Personal loans might also have <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> from 1% to 12%. You can <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">use a personal loan</a> for a variety of reasons, including debt consolidation and emergency purchases.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p>Cash advance apps generally allow you to borrow a small sum of money to tide you over until your next payday. A major benefit of this option is that these generally don't require a credit check. But, while many of these apps don’t charge traditional interest, other fees like subscription fees, fast funding fees, and optional tips can quickly increase your cost to borrow.</p><p>You can usually borrow anywhere from less than $100 to $500 (or possibly more, depending on the app). Payment is typically due by your next paycheck.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.earnin.com/\">EarnIn</a>, <a href=\"https://dave.com/extra-cash-advances\">Dave</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.moneylion.com/cash-advance/instacash\">MoneyLion</a> are some apps to consider for a cash advance.</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/500-loan\">5 Types of $500 Loans and How to Get One</a></p><h3>Car title loans</h3><p>A car title loan is a small loan that is secured by your vehicle. These also may have triple-digit APRs, and if you don’t repay the loan on time, the lender can repossess your car. You typically need to own the vehicle before you can use it as collateral for the loan, and are generally limited to borrowing 25% to 50% of your car’s value.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> are small, short-term loans that don’t require a credit check. But the trade-off is that they have significant fees, which translate into triple-digit APRs. Most payday loans charge fees from $10 to $30 for every $100 that you borrow. These loans are also limited in how much you can borrow, usually up to $500, and must be repaid by your next paycheck, which is usually 2 to 4 weeks. If you're considering a payday loan, use a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> to see the true cost of the loan.</p><h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p>Some federal credit unions (FCUs) offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loans</a> to help consumers avoid taking out payday loans. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) caps the APRs of payday alternative loans at 28%.</p><p>The NCUA allows FCUs to offer two types of PALs: PALs I and PALs II. The NCUA doesn’t allow an FCU to issue more than one type of PAL to a single applicant at one time, however.</p><p>Here’s a table that breaks down some key differences between both PAL options.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:233002":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"233002","content":"<h2>How to borrow money for emergencies</h2><p>Here are the steps you can take to apply for a personal loan for emergencies.</p><ol><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Prequalify</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Many lenders, especially online lenders, allow you to prequalify for a personal loan <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">without harming your credit</a>.

Before you apply for one, explore these alternatives.</p><h3>401(k) loan</h3><p>If you have a 401(k) with a vested balance, you may be able to borrow from it. Your plan needs to allow loans, and you'll be limited to half of your vested balance or up to $50,000, whichever is less, in most cases. (Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if half your vested balance is $10,000 or less.)&nbsp;</p><p>Since there's no credit check or minimum income requirements, <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\">getting a 401(k) loan</a> may be especially worth considering if you're struggling to qualify for a loan elsewhere.

But keep in mind that if you extend the repayment period, you might end up paying more over time, even if debt consolidation lowers your interest rate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lower monthly payments:</strong>&nbsp;Even if you’ll pay more in the long run to consolidate debt, it could be worth it to get a lower monthly payment now.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Manageable monthly payments:</strong> If you can’t manage the minimum payments on your debts and are at risk of incurring late fees or entering default, a debt consolidation loan may help you get a lower payment and avoid the negative credit impact of paying late.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Could improve your credit score:</strong> Using a personal loan to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">pay off credit card debt&nbsp;</a>reduces your credit utilization ratio, which may improve your credit score within a month. On-time payments can have an even larger impact over time — which is why it can make sense to get a more affordable monthly payment even if you pay more over the loan’s term.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Quick and easy application:</strong> Unlike other debt relief options like debt settlement, personal loans don’t require extensive time or paperwork. You can typically&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply online</a> in minutes and get a decision either instantly or within a few days.</li><li><strong>Quick funding:</strong>&nbsp;In most cases, you can receive your debt consolidation loan funds within a few business days. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/reprise-personal-loans-review\">Reprise</a> typically disburses loan funds electronically within 24 to 48 business hours. Note that it often takes longer for your creditors to receive the funds if you choose direct payment.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Potential for further credit damage:</strong> Applying for any loan typically requires a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a>, which has a slight negative impact on your credit score. While repaying your loan responsibly can improve your credit score, late or missed payments could further harm your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>May require an upfront fee:</strong>&nbsp;Most lenders that offer personal loans for bad credit charge an origination fee, an upfront fee that can reduce the amount you receive. Along with the interest rate, origination fees and other upfront lender fees are factored into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which represents the total annual borrowing cost.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Not ideal for extensive debt:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re overwhelmed with debt, lowering the APR may not make enough of a dent to help your situation. “When a person’s debt is more than their annual income or a person’s wages are being garnished, a debt consolidation loan generally is not the best option,” says Jillian Hishaw, owner and attorney at Hishaw Law LLC, a bankruptcy firm.</li><li><strong>May not address underlying issues:</strong>&nbsp;A debt consolidation loan won’t help you earn more income or spend less. If you’re struggling to manage your finances on a regular basis, you may want to get help from a credit counselor or check whether you qualify for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/benefits\">government benefits</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How to compare debt consolidation loans for bad credit</h2><p>The first step to getting any loan, especially if you have bad credit, is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loans/borrower/step/amount\">prequalify</a>. This is a way to quickly screen potential lenders to find those most likely to approve your application.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\"><strong>Review your credit score</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and income:</strong> Find lenders with minimum credit score and income requirements lower than yours.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compare loan amounts:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">Personal loans for bad credit</a> typically range from $1,000 to $35,000, depending on the lender. Make sure the lender offers the amount you need to consolidate your debt.</li><li><strong>Consider fees:</strong> In addition to interest, some personal loan lenders charge an origination fee, which may be deducted from the loan amount and affects how much cash you receive. If you’ve been able to prequalify with multiple lenders, compare each loan’s APR to get an idea of the total borrowing cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review repayment terms:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders offer longer repayment terms than others. If you’re on a tight budget, you can typically achieve a lower monthly payment by choosing a longer repayment term, but you may pay more in interest over time.</li><li><strong>Look for creditor-direct pay:</strong> Some debt consolidation lenders offer direct payment to your creditors, which eliminates the temptation to spend the loan funds on something else. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/achieve-personal-loans-review\">Achieve</a> offers to pay your creditors directly, and you could qualify for a rate discount with the autopay option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Find lenders that allow a cosigner or co-borrower:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders allow you to apply with a cosigner, which is someone who guarantees repayment of the loan, or a co-borrower, which is someone who is also responsible for the loan and has access to the funds. Applying with a cosigner or co-borrower who has good credit can help you qualify for a debt consolidation loan or get a lower APR.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Check lender reputation:</strong>&nbsp;Evaluate customer reviews on third-party websites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> to determine the lender’s reputation for customer service.</li></ol><h2>How to get a debt consolidation loan with bad credit</h2><ol><li>Add up all the debt you want to consolidate and note the interest rate you’re paying on each debt.</li><li>Prequalify using a loan marketplace like Credible to get APR estimates.</li><li>Compare loan options based on features like APR and repayment terms.</li><li>Choose the lowest-cost option with an affordable monthly payment.</li><li>Consider asking a friend or family member with good credit to cosign or apply jointly with you.</li><li>Proceed with the formal application and authorize a hard credit check (in most cases).</li><li>Upload any required documents, like proof of income.</li><li>Review the terms and conditions if you’re offered a loan.</li><li>E-sign your loan documents to get your cash or have the money sent to your creditors.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>Tips on improving your chances of approval</h2><p>Getting a debt consolidation loan with bad credit can be a challenge. If you’re struggling to get approved or to achieve a low enough APR to make debt consolidation worthwhile, consider the following tactics:</p><ul><li><strong>Consider bad credit lenders:</strong> A few online lenders specialize in serving borrowers with bad credit and may evaluate factors beyond your credit score. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/upstart-personal-loans-review\">Upstart</a> considers educational background when making lending decisions and accepts applicants with limited credit history.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Look to credit unions:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">Credit union personal loans</a> may be easier to qualify for than bank loans if you have bad credit. Credit unions are member-owned, not-for-profit institutions that offer lower rates and often consider other criteria when evaluating borrowers.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong>&nbsp;Some bad credit lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loans</a> for debt consolidation, which require you to offer a valuable asset as collateral. Securing the loan with an asset, like your vehicle title or a CD, can make it easier to qualify or get a lower APR. Just be aware that the lender can seize your collateral if you fail to repay.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner or co-applicant:</strong>&nbsp;Asking a friend or family member with good credit to guarantee the loan gives the lender reassurance and improves your odds of approval. While few lenders allow cosigners, many allow co-borrowers. Co-borrowers have equal access to the loan funds in addition to guaranteeing repayment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;It may be worthwhile to improve your credit score before applying for a debt consolidation loan. Use a tool like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.experian.com/credit/score-boost/\">Experian Boost</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.self.inc/lpg/mpa/rent-bills-landing/\">Self</a> to build credit via your on-time rent and utility payments. You can also improve your score by paying down debt, making on-time payments, and becoming an authorized user on the card of someone with good credit.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296590":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296590","content":"<h2>How to improve your credit score</h2><p>Here are a few steps you can take:</p><ol><li><strong>Dispute credit report errors:</strong> If you find errors on your credit report, <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/\">dispute them directly with the credit bureaus</a>. Assuming the reports are incorrect and you've supplied enough supporting information to the credit bureau, they may be removed from your credit report, along with any negative impact they had on your credit score.</li><li><strong>Address past-due debts:</strong> If you have any, pay them as soon as possible. Yes, your missed payments will still appear on your credit report. But getting out of delinquency will help improve your credit.</li><li><strong>Get a credit-builder loan:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">Credit-builder loans</a> come with shorter repayment terms — from six months to two years — and your funds are deposited into a locked savings account until you've paid off the loan. With this <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-types\">type of loan</a>, you'll make regular principal and interest payments that are reported to each of the three major credit bureaus, and you'll get your funds at the end of the loan term.</li><li><strong>Improve your payment history:</strong> Payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Set up autopay and calendar alerts for due dates to avoid missing payments.</li><li><strong>Reduce your credit utilization:</strong> You can improve your credit score by using less of your available credit on your cards or other revolving credit accounts. If you currently have <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/pay-off-credit-card-debt\">credit card debt</a>, consider paying some of it off before applying for a debt consolidation loan.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> This is one of the fastest and most effective ways to improve your credit score. Ask a loved one or friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card. You'll get credit for the positive payment history on your credit report and can benefit from their available credit, which can quickly boost your credit score.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/where-can-i-get-a-personal-loan\">Where to Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Alternatives to consolidating debt with bad credit</h2><h3>Debt management plan</h3><p>A nonprofit credit counseling agency can provide budgeting advice and also enroll you in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>, which is a type of debt consolidation. Under the plan, you’ll make one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, which will negotiate lower rates and fees with your creditors on your behalf.&nbsp;</p><h3>Balance transfer credit card</h3><p>Credit card issuers sometimes run promotions that allow existing cardholders to avoid interest on balance transfers from other credit cards — but only if your account is in good standing. Your credit card company may not notify you of this, so check your account for offers. Promotions can run for six months or longer, which could help you save money on debt repayment. However, many cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5%, that can offset your savings.</p><h3>Debt settlement</h3><p>When you go through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-settlement-pros-cons\">debt settlement program</a>, a company works to settle your debt on your behalf. For instance, the company may negotiate with lenders to accept a reduced amount. But debt settlement programs often require you to stop making payments as a negotiating tactic, which can harm your credit and possibly lead to legal action from your creditors. Plus, they can take years and results are not guaranteed. This is not a course we generally recommend.</p><h3>Bankruptcy</h3><p>Bankruptcy is a legal process that helps people get rid of debt. Depending on the type of bankruptcy, the court either oversees the liquidation of your non-exempt assets or the completion of a repayment plan. Most remaining debts are typically discharged.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-bankruptcy\">Bankruptcy</a> stays on your credit report for up to 10 years. If you have good credit, bankruptcy can cause a significant drop in your credit score. But if you already have poor credit, you might see an increase in your credit score once the debt is discharged. More importantly, you’ll have the opportunity to create good credit habits and improve your score once you’re debt-free.&nbsp;</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;32 lenders across 1,216 data points to find the best debt consolidation loans for bad credit.

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Flexible eligibility requirements</li><li>Offers secured options</li><li>Competitive bad-credit loans</li><li>Physical presence</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Availability</li><li>Origination fees</li><li>High starting APR</li><li>Low maximum loan amount</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$1,500 to $20,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>Origination fee, unsuccessful payment fee, late fee</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Discounts</p><div><p>None</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must have photo I.D. issued by U.S. federal, state or local government</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Min. income</p><div><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Customer service</p><div><p>Phone, email</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Soft credit check</p><div><p>Yes</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Time to get funds</p><div><p>As soon as 1 to 2 days after acceptance</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan use</p><div><p>All except business, and education</p></div></div></div></div></div><a class="LenderTableMoreDetails_readFullReview__0Peup styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_semiBold__25tTb styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../onemain-financial-personal-loans-review.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read full review</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-32"><span class="neutral disclaimer">All APRs reflect autopay and loyalty discounts where available</span><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../legal-pages/pl-general-disclosures.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read more about Rates and Terms</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../terms.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Terms of Service</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../privacy.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Privacy Policy</a></div></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="best-debt-consolidation-loans-for-bad-credit">Best debt consolidation loans for bad credit</h2></section><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to compare money-borrowing apps\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eComparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBorrowing limits:\u003c/strong\u003e The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use.

If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding time:\u003c/strong\u003e There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue.
