Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher. However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.","review":{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4.1,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"J.R.

While many financial professionals advise against using IRA funds for a home purchase, others think it can be a smart move if you plan far enough ahead.</p><p>Here are the benefits and drawbacks to consider before you use your IRA for a home purchase:</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>The money allows you to come up with the minimum down payment.</li><li>If you and your spouse are both first-time homebuyers, you can each take advantage of the $10,000 withdrawal.</li><li>Setting aside money in a Roth IRA for a future home purchase can potentially earn you better returns than if you were to store that money in a taxable savings account.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a></li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>Time is one of your biggest assets for earning compound returns from retirement investing. The opportunity cost of taking $10,000 from an IRA now could be more than $100,000 in retirement savings later. Homes in most areas don’t appreciate nearly as much as stocks.</li><li>There’s a good chance that $10,000 will not make a big enough dent in your down payment to prevent you from needing <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-mortgage-insurance\">private mortgage insurance</a>.</li><li>A $10,000 withdrawal from a traditional IRA may only amount to $8,800 or less after taxes, depending on your federal and state brackets.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to withdrawing from your IRA</h2><p>If you don’t want to withdraw from your IRA to buy a home, you have other options for funding a down payment.</p><h3>Borrow from your 401(k)</h3><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Homebuyers who don’t want to take a permanent hit to their retirement savings</p><p>Unlike IRAs, 401(k) plans allow for loans. You can borrow up to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less; if your balance is $10,000 or less, you can borrow up to $10,000.</p><p>One of the benefits of a 401(k) loan versus a distribution is you don’t have to pay taxes or penalties on the loan, and any interest you pay goes back into your retirement account.</p><p>If you don’t repay the loan, it will be treated as a taxable distribution and subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.</p><h3>Borrow from your IRA</h3><p><strong>Best for: </strong>Homebuyers who have nearly enough for a down payment or avoiding PMI</p><p>While IRAs do not allow for loans, they do allow for rollovers. The rollover rules allow IRA funds to be outside an IRA account for 60 days. The idea behind this strategy is to withdraw money from your IRA, use it for your house, and then repay it within 60 days. You’re not actually doing a rollover; you’re just taking advantage of rollover rules.</p><p>This can potentially save you from having to pay PMI or allow you to buy a home sooner. However, unless you’re confident you’ll have enough income to repay the “rollover” within 60 days, you might end up owing an early withdrawal penalty, which could outweigh the benefits of this strategy.</p><h3>Take a hardship distribution from your 401(k)</h3><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Homebuyers whose employers don’t offer 401(k) loans</p><p>Withdrawing money from a 401(k) to buy a home means sacrificing potential investment earnings on the principal you withdraw. You can potentially withdraw much more than $10,000, too, because hardship withdrawals are based on your financial need.</p><p>Yes, the IRS considers buying a home to be a “hardship.” Hardship withdrawals are subject to income tax and the 10% early withdrawal penalty. You’ll have to wait six months after the withdrawal before you can start contributing to your 401(k) again.</p><h3>Get a government-secured mortgage</h3><p><strong>Best for: </strong>Qualified military service members and/or homebuyers with credit scores below 620</p><p>A VA loan allows qualified military service members to put nothing down to buy a home, while an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-an-fha-loan\">FHA loan</a> allows anyone to put as little as 3.5% down. USDA loans also require no down payment for low-income homebuyers outside big cities.</p><p>These mortgage loans have more lenient underwriting guidelines for borrowers because the government provides a loan guarantee to the lender.</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/types-of-mortgage-loans\">5 Types of Mortgage Loans: Which One Is for You?</a></p><h3>Get a low-down-payment conventional mortgage</h3><p><strong>Best for: </strong>Homebuyers with good credit</p><p>With a credit score of at least 620, you may qualify for a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/conventional-mortgage\">conventional mortgage</a> with as little as 3% down. You’ll need to pay for PMI until you have 20% equity, but you’ll be able to own a home sooner. The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate and the less expensive your PMI will be.</p><h3>Look into mortgage assistance programs</h3><p><strong>Best for: </strong>Homebuyers who may not be able to come up with the minimum down payment</p><p>Instead of dipping into your IRA for a down payment, look into a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/first-time-home-buyer-programs\">mortgage assistance program</a>.

One guideline you can follow is the 28% rule, which suggests you spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. Let’s use the earlier example that assumes a 30-year loan term and 6% APR, which results in a monthly payment of $1,498.88. Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

Here are some strategies to ensure you're borrowing responsibly:</p><ul><li><strong>Estimate your future income:</strong> Look up entry-level salaries for auto technicians in your area. A good guideline is to borrow no more than your expected starting salary after graduation.</li><li><strong>Only borrow what you need: </strong>Don't accept the full loan amount just because it's offered. Try to limit borrowing to essential costs like tuition, tools, and basic living expenses.</li><li><strong>Look for free opportunities first: </strong>Always apply for grants and scholarships before turning to loans. These forms of financial aid don't need to be repaid and can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.</li><li><strong>Start budgeting: </strong>Create a budget to track your expenses during school and prepare for future loan payments. This can help you avoid overspending and build good financial habits.</li></ul><h2>Cost of automotive tech training</h2><p>The cost of automotive technician training varies based on the type of program and school you attend. Certificate programs at technical schools typically cost between $5,000 and $20,000 and can take anywhere from six months to two years to complete. If you're pursuing a two-year associate degree, the average tuition is $4,050 per year in 2024-25, according to the College Board.</p><h2>Salary outlook for auto service technicians</h2><p>In 2024, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $49,670, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/diesel-service-technicians-and-mechanics.htm\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS).

To qualify for a OneMain loan through Credible, it’s recommended that you earn at least $10,000 annually.</li><li><strong>Larger loans for bad credit:</strong> On average, no other Credible lending partner approved larger loans for borrowers with credit scores below 580.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Secured and cosigned loans:</strong>&nbsp;Securing a loan with an asset, such as a car or a house, or using a cosigner could make it easier to qualify. Still, remember that secured loans are risky for you (you could use your collateral if you default) and cosigned loans are risky for your cosigner (they're responsible for repayment if you default, and their score could be damaged if you make late payments).</li><li><strong>Physical branches:</strong> If you prefer in-person customer service, OneMain has more than 1,300 branch locations in 44 states.</li></ul><h3>Details on the cons</h3><ul><li><strong>High starting APR (and high rates in general):</strong> OneMain's starting APR of 18.00% puts it at a disadvantage against many other personal loan lenders, although its rates for borrowers with bad credit are typical (average 31.00% on loans through Credible).

Flat fees vary by state ($25 to $500). Percentage-based fees also vary by state (1% to 10%).</li><li><strong>Not available nationwide:</strong> OneMain Financial personal loans aren't available in Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont.</li></ul><h3>How to qualify for a OneMain Financial personal loan</h3><p>OneMain considers eligibility criteria, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score and financial history:</strong> While OneMain Financial doesn’t have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirement</a> when you apply directly, your credit and financial history will be considered. This includes reviewing how many loans and credit cards you have, how much you owe, if you pay your bills on time, and how long you’ve been managing credit. The company will also consider whether you have filed for bankruptcy, and if so, how you’ve handled your credit since.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income and employment:</strong> You’ll need to have enough income to qualify for the loan you’re applying for. There is no minimum income requirement, though it’s recommended that you make $10,000 per year or more. The main concern is that you have the ability to repay the loan.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">When you prequalify</a>, you’ll be asked what type of employment you have, whether you’re employed, self-employed, retired, or have another income source.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Value of collateral:</strong>&nbsp;If you applied for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>, the lender needs to evaluate your collateral to determine if its value is sufficient to support the loan.

These accounts offer tax advantages for families who set aside money specifically for education expenses. Contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses like tuition, fees, books, and room and board.</p><p>You can open a 529 plan through your state or a financial institution. In some cases, your state may even offer a tax deduction or credit for contributing to its plan.</p><h3>Scholarships and grants</h3><p>In addition to savings, you can reduce your college costs by applying for financial aid. The most valuable type is free aid, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>. Federal grants are available through programs like the Pell Grant, while colleges and private organizations may offer additional scholarships or need-based awards.</p><h3>Part-time work</h3><p>While many students <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">work during college</a> to help pay for tuition, Kantrowitz advises limiting your work hours, if possible. While it sounds counterproductive to lower your earnings during your college years, Kantrowitz notes that students who work full-time are less likely to graduate compared to those who work 12 hours or less.</p><p>Another option is the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study</a> program. This form of financial aid allows eligible students to earn money through part-time jobs while in school. Work-study is typically reserved for students with financial need, and the money earned doesn't have to be repaid.</p><h3>Tuition reimbursement programs</h3><p>If you're already in the workforce, check whether your employer offers a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">tuition reimbursement program</a>. Some companies provide tax-free benefits to help cover the cost of tuition, books, and other school-related expenses, and in some cases, even student loan repayment.</p><p>Under IRS rules, employer-paid educational assistance is tax-free up to $5,250 per employee per year. That limit applies to both tuition and student loan repayment benefits combined. Any amount above that becomes taxable.</p><h3>Student loans</h3><p>Another common way to pay for college is with student loans. The federal government offers two main types: <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">subsidized and unsubsidized loans</a>. Subsidized loans are for students with financial need, and they don't accrue interest while you're in school, which can help keep your total costs lower. Unsubsidized loans start accruing interest right away, but they're one of the most accessible forms of student aid.</p><p>If federal loans don't fully cover your expenses, you can also apply for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> through banks, credit unions, or online lenders. These loans are based on your credit score and income, and they often come with higher interest rates, especially if you don't have strong credit.</p><p>Most undergraduates need a cosigner to qualify for a private loan. In fact, 84% of borrowers who applied for a private student loan in 2024 did so with a cosigner, according to data from the Credible marketplace.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:299438":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"299438","content":"<h2>What to know before taking out student loans</h2><p>Student loans are one of the most common <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/How-to-Pay-for-College\">ways to pay for college</a>, but they're also one of the most expensive. Many undergraduate students take out loans without fully understanding what it means for their financial future.</p><p>“Every dollar you borrow will cost about two dollars by the time you repay the debt,” says Kantrowitz. “Live like a student while you're in school, so you won't have to live like a student after you graduate.”</p><p>Kantrowitz also shares a simple rule of thumb: If your starting salary after college is higher than your total student loan balance, you'll likely be able to pay off your loans within 10 years.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost.

They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

While you could buy a home without getting a mortgage, the average American cannot afford an all-cash payment and needs financing. According to a 2024 study from the National Association of REALTORS®, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights-11-04-2024_2.pdf\">74% of homebuyers used a mortgage</a> to buy a home. Homebuyers typically pay a set percentage of the home price upfront (known as the down payment) and then pay back the loan on a monthly basis over a set number of years (typically 15 or 30 years). The monthly payments include interest and other fees. The lender you work with sets the interest rate on your loan, and that figure can change depending on several micro factors, such as your unique financial profile, including your credit score and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), as well as macro factors, such as the Federal Funds rate and inflation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of mortgage loans</h2><p>There are five major types of mortgages borrowers can choose from, based on their needs:</p><h3>FHA loans&nbsp;</h3><p>FHA loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Because a government agency backs <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-an-fha-loan\">FHA loans</a>, lenders can accept lower credit scores, smaller down payments, and low closing costs — while still offering competitive rates.</p><h3>VA loans&nbsp;</h3><p>VA loans are insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs and available to eligible veterans, service members, and surviving spouses. The government backing makes VA loans less risky for lenders, so they can set low interest rates, require no down payment, and offer special refinancing options.</p><h3>USDA loans&nbsp;</h3><p>USDA loans are guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture. These also come with no down payment, but borrowers must pay mortgage insurance upfront and throughout the life of the loan. They’ll also need to meet income restrictions and buy a home in a designated rural area to qualify.</p><h3>Conventional loan&nbsp;</h3><p>Conventional loans are funded by banks and credit unions but aren't backed by a government agency. A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/conforming-loans\">conforming conventional loan</a> meets special criteria designed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). These mortgages come with higher borrowing limits compared to FHA loans, and borrowers can save money by eventually getting rid of private mortgage insurance.</p><h3>Jumbo loan&nbsp;</h3><p>Jumbo loans are conventional loans that exceed the dollar limit set by the FHFA. The conventional limit is $766,550 throughout most of the U.S., but it stretches to $1,149,825 in some high-cost areas. Compared to the other loan programs, borrowers usually need better credit scores and larger down payments to qualify for these mortgages.</p><h2>How to choose a mortgage lender</h2><p>When choosing a mortgage lender, you want the right mix of low rates, great customer service, a speedy closing, and the best home loan for your situation.

When doing your research, ask multiple lenders about requirements surrounding your credit score, down payment, and DTI.</li><li><strong>Customer service: </strong>The lender you choose should also have a strong track record of providing good customer service. You can check out ratings from J.D.

These factors are likely to vary between lenders.</li></ul><h2>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Applying for a mortgage can take a few weeks or months, depending on how quickly you find a home and get your offer accepted. When you’re ready to apply for a mortgage, here are the important steps you’ll need to follow:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around: </strong>Every lender offers its loan products and charges different interest rates and closing costs, so it’s a good idea to do some research before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved: </strong>A pre-approval letter shows how much you can borrow and the rate you might receive, which can guide your home search and help you set a budget. During the process, you’ll need to provide details like your income, estimated monthly debts, credit score, and some info about what type of home you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Make an offer on a home: </strong>Once you find a home you like that’s in your price range, you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-make-an-offer-on-a-house\">submit a purchase offer</a> to the seller and include your pre-approval letter.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Apply for the mortgage: </strong>If the seller accepts your offer, then you’ll sign an agreement and move forward with the purchase. This is when you’ll officially apply for a mortgage with the lender you chose. The lender will need the purchase and sale agreement along with your W-2 forms, tax returns, recent pay stubs, and bank statements.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:236902":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"236902","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>To determine the best mortgage companies, Credible collected over 300 data points on 16 lenders and evaluated them on several different categories: rates and fees, reputation, eligibility, efficiency, customer experience, and discounts and perks.

The stay usually lasts while the case is pending in federal court. What happens next depends on the type of bankruptcy you file: Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294518":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294518","content":"<h3>Chapter 7</h3><p>Chapter 7 is the most common type for individuals. “It is typically what you think of when considering bankruptcy,” says Ashley F. Morgan, attorney and owner of Ashley F. Morgan Law, PC, a law office focused on bankruptcy and debt management solutions. “It is a three- to four-month process that wipes away as much debt as possible.”</p><p>To qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your income needs to be below a certain threshold. (If it’s not less than your state’s median income, you’ll need to pass a means test.) After you file, a court-appointed trustee reviews your filing and holds a meeting to verify your information and move the case forward. The trustee also sells any non-exempt property, like a vacation home or extra vehicle, to pay off debts, while the remaining (exempt) debts get discharged — which means you won’t be responsible for repayment. Note that some debts, like alimony and child support, are not dischargeable through bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy generally stays on your credit report for 10 years after filing.</p><h3>Chapter 13</h3><p>With Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you can protect your assets while entering a repayment plan to pay off your debts — typically over three to five years. To qualify, your unsecured debts must be less than $526,700, and secured debts must be less than $1,580,125 as of the filing date. After completing the payment plan and a financial management course, the court may discharge your remaining outstanding debts.</p><p>Morgan adds that selling assets after filing Chapter 13 may require court approval. You also may need trustee approval before taking on new debt throughout the process. After filing, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy remains on your credit report for seven years.</p><h3>Pros and cons of bankruptcy</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294338","content":"<h2>Similarities and differences</h2><p>Here's how debt consolidation and bankruptcy stack up:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294342":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294342","content":"<h2>Impact on credit</h2><p>Debt consolidation loans and bankruptcy can affect your credit score, but in different ways.</p><h3>Debt consolidation</h3><p>When you apply for a debt consolidation loan, the lender usually conducts a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard credit check</a>, which can cause your score to dip by a few points. The drop can impact your score for up to a year, though a hard inquiry appears on your report for two years. The biggest impact on your score happens once you get the loan.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re using an installment loan, like a personal loan, to pay off credit card debt, you could see your score rise quickly and significantly. This is because you’d reduce your credit utilization once the cards are paid off, and credit utilization contributes up to 30% to your FICO score. If you make payments on time each month, you should see your credit score further improve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>But your other spending habits matter, too. Howard Dvorkin, a CPA, debt solutions author, and the founder and chairman of Debt.com, warns against being frivolous with spending after consolidating, especially with credit cards. “If you’ve successfully emerged from debt consolidation, you don’t want to undo everything you just accomplished,” says Dvorkin. “Never use a credit card to spend money you don’t have. Consider your plastic as a cash replacement, not a floating loan.” Otherwise, you might end up in another debt cycle.</p><h3>Bankruptcy</h3><p>With bankruptcy, “The credit score hit is relative,” says Morgan. “If you have perfect credit, you see a drop. But if you are already 90 to 180 days behind on debt payments, you likely will see an improvement on your credit.”</p><p>However, bankruptcy remains on your credit report for up to 10 years, and can affect your ability to qualify for new loans, a mortgage, a place to rent, and even a job — especially for the first few years. Potential creditors, landlords, and employers will typically see a bankruptcy as a black mark on your credit, even if your actual score has improved post-filing.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294346":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294346","content":"<h2>Which is the better choice?</h2><p>Which option is best for your current situation? Consider these scenarios when debt consolidation might make more sense than bankruptcy, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><h3>When debt consolidation make more sense</h3><p>A debt consolidation loan may be the best option when you:</p><ul><li><strong>Can afford a lower monthly payment:</strong> If you have income to put toward debt payments, but your current payments are too high, you could potentially lower them with a long-term debt consolidation loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Still have good credit:</strong> If your credit hasn’t suffered from one or more past-due accounts, you could potentially qualify for a lower rate than what you’re paying now (especially if you have credit card debt), thereby saving money and lowering monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Want to improve your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;By consolidating credit card debt with an installment loan, you could see credit score gains within one month. While lowering your monthly payment so it’s more affordable could help you avoid late payments, which could also improve your score.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Have an emergency situation or expense:</strong> “If you got into debt because of an accident, illness, or natural disaster, a debt consolidation loan can bridge the gap until you get back on your feet,” says Dvorkin.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Scenarios when bankruptcy makes more sense</h3><p>Bankruptcy is often a last-resort decision once debt collection activity has started. Consider it when:</p><ul><li><strong>Other debt payment strategies haven't worked:</strong> “If someone has been trying to pay down debt and has seen no progress for a year, then bankruptcy may make sense,” says Morgan. This is especially true if a person doesn't predict any increases to their income in the foreseeable future, which could make it easier to pay off debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A financial reset could get you back on track:</strong> If a long jobless spell, medical issues, or other situation has led to overwhelming, runaway debt, a clean slate could allow you to rebuild your savings and credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You have bad credit and low income:</strong> If your credit score has already suffered and you don’t expect your income to change, a bankruptcy could provide needed relief and might actually help you improve your credit going forward.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You’re nearing retirement with little saved:</strong> When consulting older clients, Morgan also weighs retirement savings. “If you are 50 years old with limited money saved for retirement, any disposable income likely should go toward saving for retirement and not paying down debt,” she says. In this case, a timely filing could halt collections and free up cash so older borrowers can redirect income to their retirement accounts.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Alternative funding options to consider</h2><p>Debt consolidation and bankruptcy aren’t your only options. You might also try:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit counseling:</strong> Nonprofit credit counselors work with you and your financial situation to map a plan for paying off your debt, like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>. If you opt into a debt management plan, a credit counselor can negotiate your debts on your behalf, roll your debts into a single payment, and potentially lower your interest rates. The U.S. Trustee program lists&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111\">government-approved credit counseling agencies</a>.</li><li><strong>Strategic debt payments:</strong> DIY your debt with a clear payment strategy.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-snowball-method\">Debt snowball</a> is a popular method where you make minimum payments on all debts each month and put any extra cash toward the smallest debts to wipe them away first for quick wins. With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-avalanche-method\">debt avalanche method</a>, you target the highest-interest debt first to speed debt payoff and save money on interest.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Balance transfer credit card:</strong> Move your debt to a new credit card, preferably with a 0% introductory APR, to help you pay off debt interest-free or with a lower rate than you currently have. Some cards offer 0% APR for up to 21 months, after which your balance will be subject to the regular APR. This method works best when you're confident you can pay off the balance within the introductory period. Keep in mind that card issuers usually charge a fee of 3% to 5% of the transferred amount.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Creditor negotiations:</strong> Contact your creditors to negotiate a lower interest rate or a reduced balance. They aren't required to oblige, but some creditors may be willing to work with you if you have a concrete proposal, such as agreeing to automatic payments or making a lump sum payment — especially if you’re already late on payments.</li><li><strong>Home equity funding:</strong> Borrow against the equity in your home to potentially save on interest with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit</a>.

Unfortunately, doing so can be difficult because GreenSky doesn't share a list of its merchant partners.</p><p>From there, the merchant will show you how to apply. The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">eligibility requirements</a> and application process can vary between programs, but GreenSky generally requires you to share basic personal information, such as your name, monthly income, and Social Security number. You'll also need to prove your identity with a government-issued photo ID.</p><h2>GreenSky personal loan fees and penalties</h2><p>GreenSky doesn't have set <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">loan fees</a> for every program it offers. The costs will vary between the programs of different contractors. However, they can include interest, a contractor fee and/or a merchant fee and an activation fee. Once approved, you can review the proposed GreenSky loan contract to see all the fees and penalties that will apply to you.</p><h2>How GreenSky compares to other lenders</h2><p>GreenSky is not a lender and doesn't offer loan programs directly. Instead, it connects the customers of home improvement merchants with loans from banks. In contrast, lenders provide home improvement loans directly to customers — you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">apply on a lender's website</a>, get approved, and use the funds to pay the contractor(s) of your choice.</p><p>If you're working with a contractor that offers a GreenSky program, you can check out their plans.

An excellent credit score indicates you’re a low-risk borrower — it assures lenders that you’re very likely to repay your debts on time. If you have excellent credit, you’re more likely to qualify for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">best personal loans</a> and other loan options with low interest rates and fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit scoring models assign you a credit score based on the information in your credit report, like your payment history and outstanding debts. An excellent credit score is a FICO score of 800 or greater. An estimated 90% of top lenders use FICO scores to evaluate applicants, making it the most commonly used scoring model. Some lenders use VantageScore instead — a VantageScore of 781 or above is typically considered excellent.</p><p>The table below shows the FICO score ranges for different credit ratings.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:307778":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"307778","content":"<h2>How having excellent credit helps you qualify</h2><p>Lenders consider various factors, primarily credit scores, to weigh the risk of approving a borrower's application for a personal loan, mortgage, and other types of credit. They also use credit scores in determining a borrower's interest rate. For example, people with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit</a> and a history of late payments are more likely to default on a new loan, so a lender may deny the application or charge a higher interest rate to compensate for the increased risk.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, people with excellent credit present a relatively low risk to lenders. “A high credit score doesn’t just open the door, it changes the room you walk into,” says Ethan Aiem, CEO at Klendify, a business capital platform. “Lenders see you as low-risk, which usually means better interest rates, higher limits, and faster approvals.”&nbsp;</p><p>An excellent credit score can help you qualify for more loan options, but Aiem says it can even give you negotiating power, since most lenders will want your business. “When I see borrowers with a 760+ score, they often qualify for the best offers from multiple lenders and can play them against each other for better terms,” he says. Some lenders, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a>, even offer to beat competitors’ unsecured personal loan rates under certain conditions.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to use a personal loan with excellent credit wisely</h2><p>“Debt is a tool that can be used wisely or poorly,” says Michael LaCivita, CFP, Financial Advisor at Domain Money. “Someone with good monthly cash flow and excellent credit could use a personal loan for a larger purchase with the understanding the loan could be paid off without impacting financial goals,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you’re expecting a bonus in the future, “a personal loan could be used for a large expense and paid off with the bonus money,” says LaCivita.&nbsp;</p><p>Though you can typically use a personal loan for almost any household expense, some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">personal loan uses</a> are more strategic than others. Some ways you can use a personal loan to improve your financial situation include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">Consolidating debt</a> to save money on interest</li><li>Paying for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvements</a> to increase your home’s resale value</li><li>Funding relocation to accept a higher-paying job offer</li><li>Funding a medical procedure to improve your health or reduce ongoing medical costs</li><li>Covering an emergency expense to avoid dipping into your retirement savings or taking out a high-interest loan</li><li>Covering everyday expenses while you receive education or training to improve your career prospects</li><li>Starting a small business or side hustle that you expect will be profitable</li></ul><p>An excellent credit score gives you the advantage of lower-cost borrowing, which makes it easier to use debt to achieve your financial goals. But keep in mind that taking out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-does-a-personal-loan-affect-credit-score\">personal loan may impact your credit score</a>, both positively and negatively.&nbsp;</p><p>“The biggest drop I see is from new inquiries and balance spikes right after funding,” says Aiem. To avoid any further damage to your credit, set up autopay to ensure you always make your payments on time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can make extra payments to save money on interest, but be aware that paying off an installment loan too quickly may do more harm than good. “A consistent, positive payment record over time often helps your score more than wiping everything clean overnight,” says Aiem. Having no active installment loans poses a greater risk to your credit score than having a low installment loan balance, according to FICO.&nbsp;</p><h2>Interest rates for excellent credit</h2><p>The chart below shows average interest rates selected by borrowers with excellent credit (FICO scores of 800-850) for three-year and five-year personal loans.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:307782":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"307782","content":"<h2>Average personal loan rates for excellent credit by loan purpose</h2><p>Personal loan rates for excellent credit borrowers may vary depending on how you intend to use the loan funds.

Here are the typical steps to expect.</p><h3>Research and compare lenders</h3><p>Narrow down your options by considering the factors in the section below. Check each lender’s reputation and ensure the lender is licensed to issue loans in your state.&nbsp;</p><h3>Prequalify</h3><p>Many personal loan lenders allow you to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify</a> with only a soft credit inquiry. A soft credit check won’t affect your credit score, but it’ll give the lender enough information to estimate the loan amount, APR, and term you might qualify for. This process allows you to compare your options without damaging your credit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Choose a lender and apply</h3><p>Choose the loan option that best meets your needs — ideally, choose the lowest APR out of the options that have an affordable monthly payment. Upload any additional documents the lender requires, such as pay stubs or tax returns. At this stage, the lender typically performs a hard inquiry, which can temporarily shave a few points off your score.&nbsp;</p><h3>Review the terms and sign your loan agreement</h3><p>Make sure the final rate and monthly payment work for you — the details may vary from the prequalification estimate. Be sure to check the loan agreement for incidental fees, restricted loan purposes, and the lender’s rights in the event of default. Ask any questions you may have, then e-sign your loan documents to initiate the funds transfer to your bank account.</p><h3>Receive your funds and begin making monthly payments</h3><p>Most lenders transfer the loan amount as a lump sum, less any applicable upfront fees, to your bank account within a few business days. With personal loans for debt consolidation, some lenders can send the loan funds directly to your creditors. Personal loan repayment begins right away, and late payments can damage your credit score, so set a due-date reminder or enroll in autopay.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:307802":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"307802","content":"<h2>How to compare lenders</h2><p>As you compare your options, consider loan features like:</p><ul><li><strong>Rates and fees:</strong>&nbsp;APR represents the total annual cost of borrowing, accounting for the interest rate and any upfront lender fees, such as origination fees for underwriting the loan.

If you need fast cash to cover an emergency expense, look into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day personal loans</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders offer loan amounts of up to $100,000 or more for borrowers with excellent credit, though the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">amount you qualify for</a> will also depend on your income and existing debts. If you need a small loan, pay attention to minimum borrowing amounts — you shouldn’t borrow more than you need.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lender reputation and customer service:</strong>&nbsp;Customer support options range from email-only support to in-person assistance available at brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions. Consider your needs and evaluate the lender’s quality of service by reading customer reviews on sites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a>.&nbsp;“Smaller online lenders often beat big banks on speed and service, even for top-tier borrowers,” says Aiem.&nbsp;</li><li>An excellent credit score can help you qualify with lenders that offer special perks. For example, Best Egg offers secured personal loans for homeowners with APRs as low as 5.99%, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a> offers membership benefits like a free session with a financial advisor.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to personal loans for excellent credit</h2><p>A personal loan isn’t the only financing option available to someone with excellent credit. If a personal loan doesn’t seem like the right fit for your financial situation, consider these alternatives.&nbsp;</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>A credit card is a good option for everyday purchases and smoothing out uneven cash flow. “Credit cards are great if you can pay off the balance within the month to avoid late and interest fees,” says LaCivita. “Ideally, your credit cards have travel points or other benefits to rack up while you pay off the debt quickly.” But if you need to carry a balance past the due date, it’ll cost you — the average credit card APR is 21.39%, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">the Fed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>An excellent credit score helps you qualify for 0% APR promotional offers for new cardholders, which allow you to avoid interest for a longer period of time — up to 24 billing cycles, as long as you keep up with the minimum payments. 0% APR credit cards can be helpful if you need to make a large purchase, but you should ensure you can repay the full balance before the promotional period ends.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A home equity loan allows you to borrow against your home equity, which is the portion of your home that you own outright (your home’s current value less your outstanding mortgage balance). You receive the cash as a lump sum and repay it in fixed monthly payments. Home equity loans typically offer lower interest rates, longer repayment term options, and sometimes higher borrowing limits, but they can take longer to fund and may come with closing costs. There’s also a risk of foreclosure if you fail to repay.&nbsp;</p><p>“I usually tell clients, if the purchase or project improves your long-term value, like renovations or investments, equity lending can make sense,” says Aiem. “But if you’re borrowing for short term needs or consolidation, keep it unsecured. Don’t risk your home for something that’ll be gone in six months.”</p><h3>Home equity line of credit</h3><p>A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is similar to a home equity loan in that it’s secured by the equity in your home. But instead of receiving a lump sum, you’ll get access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow against repeatedly while only paying interest on the amount you borrow. HELOCs typically have more repayment flexibility than home equity loans. But they sometimes come with fees and minimum withdrawal amounts, and there’s still a risk of foreclosure if you default.&nbsp;</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to determine the best loans for excellent credit.

The aggregator can then decide whether to repackage the loan or keep it to collect interest.</p><p>From the borrower’s perspective, not much changes when this happens. The original terms and conditions outlined in the loan agreement remain the same. You’ll typically continue making payments to your original servicer as well unless otherwise indicated.</p><p>Conforming loans typically have stricter requirements than non-conforming loans. However, they also tend to have lower <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">interest rates</a>. This makes them potentially more affordable for first-time homebuyers and low- and moderate-income borrowers with good credit.</p><h2>Conforming loan limits: What you need to know</h2><p>The FHFA changes the conforming loan limits each year, largely based on housing market changes. The new loan limits reflect changes to the average home price in the U.S. Limits vary based on where you live.</p><p>Conforming loan limits are set based on either of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>National baseline limit: </strong>In 2024, the conforming loan limit was $766,550 throughout much of the country. However, housing prices increased by 5.21% from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024. Because of this, the FHFA increased the loan limit to $806,500 for 2025.</li><li><strong>High-cost area limit: </strong>Since houses are inherently more expensive in some parts of the U.S., the high-cost area limit reflects that. In 2025, the limit is $1,209,750, which is 150% of the national baseline.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of choosing a conforming loan</h2><p>Conforming loans have several advantages over non-conforming loans that make them appealing to potential homebuyers.</p><p>“One of the benefits of conforming loans is that they may carry lower interest rates compared to non-conforming loans,” says Josh Jampedro, vice president of Home Loan Advisors.</p><p>In the case of conforming adjustable-rate mortgages, the interest rate can fluctuate over time. However, it’s often lower than fixed-rate mortgages at the beginning. This can be especially beneficial for borrowers who need lower monthly payments but anticipate a pay increase or more room in their budget later. It can also be helpful for those intending to sell their home before the lower-rate period ends.</p><p>Conforming loans also tend to have lower down payment requirements.

Non-conforming loans are any mortgages that don’t meet these guidelines.</p><p>“Non-conforming loans are there to fill in gaps where a client simply does not qualify based on conforming guidelines. Going outside the box, so to speak, carries risk for the lender, and these non-conforming loans are typically priced accordingly for that risk,” says Matt Schwartz, co-founder of VA Loan Network.</p><p>Conforming loans are more standardized than non-conforming loans and have maximum loan amounts. The qualifications, cost, and other features of non-conforming loans can vary from one lender to another.</p><p>The types of non-conforming loans are also different. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>Specialty loans for borrowers with poor credit: </strong>These typically have higher interest rates, but don’t require as much income documentation. Options include interest-only loans and loans in which the balance can increase.</li><li><strong>Government-backed loans: </strong>These include <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/fha-vs-conventional-loan\">FHA loans</a> and VA loans, which don’t adhere to conforming loan limits.</li><li><strong>Other niche loan programs: </strong>These loans are geared toward homebuyers with unusual circumstances, like self-employed individuals or doctors who’ve recently graduated. Some programs allow for the purchase of non-standard properties, like larger lots (10 acres or more) or those that generate agricultural income.</li></ul><p>“Conforming loans can be sold and have lower interest rates,” adds Andrea Viscuso, licensed real estate agent at Compass.</p><h2>How to qualify for a conforming loan</h2><p>Conforming loans typically have more stringent lending criteria than non-conforming loans.</p><p>“Conforming loans follow guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These guidelines are widely established and recognized and do not vary by much,” Jampedro says. “There may be slight differences between what Fannie Mae requires vs. Freddie Mac, such as Freddie Mac will allow for a lower payment on deferred student loans for qualifying. But for the most part, those guidelines are relatively similar, although they do vary from each other.”</p><p>With that in mind, here are the steps you generally take to qualify:</p><ol><li><strong>Review your finances and credit: </strong>Look over your income, expenses, and debts to make sure you can afford to take on a mortgage. In addition, you need a credit score of 620 or higher to qualify for a conventional conforming loan, so make sure your credit is acceptable. You can get a copy of your credit report from the major credit bureaus at <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Pay down debts: </strong>The maximum debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is 45% to 50%, depending on your credit score and other compensating factors. Paying down debt or increasing your income can boost your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Save for a down payment: </strong>Down payment requirements are usually at least 3% of the property purchase price, though some lenders may require 5% or higher. The more you can pay upfront, the less you’ll have to pay in interest over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Prepare for closing costs:</strong> As you budget your savings, don’t forget about closing costs. These are usually a percentage of the loan amount, typically 2% to 5%. In most cases, you must pay closing costs up front.</li><li><strong>Search for and compare lenders: </strong>Interest rates, loan terms, and requirements will vary across lenders, so shop around. You may want to use a free online comparison tool to make your search easier.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved: </strong>Pre-approval can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and the total cost of your loan. You’ll need certain documentation for this, including proof of income. A lender will typically also perform a hard credit inquiry to check your credit.</li><li><strong>Narrow down your list and apply: </strong>Formally apply with the lender of your choosing and wait for approval. To help the application proceed smoothly, be prepared to provide additional information if requested.</li><li><strong>Review everything and head to closing: </strong>You’ll receive a closing disclosure once the lender approves you for a loan. It will include the details of your loan, including important terms and your monthly payment amount. Review it carefully. If everything looks good, head to your scheduled closing date to go over and sign the final documents. Don’t forget to bring your ID.</li></ol><p>“For those seeking a conforming loan, your qualification will be based on credit, income, and assets,” Schwartz says. “The stronger your income and assets are, the lower the credit score you can get away with. The same goes for credit, the stronger the scores are, the lower the income and the assets can be. Within guidelines, of course.”</p><p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Depending on loan type, different lenders in the United States offer loans to consumers with credit scores as low as 620, 580, or even 500.

Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Unlike student loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">college scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> don't have to be repaid - which makes them a great way to pay for school. There's no limit to how many scholarships and grants you can get, so it's a good idea to apply for as many as you can.</p><p>Many scholarships and grants are specifically designed for veterinary students, such as the:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.akc.org/press-releases/american-kennel-club-announces-recipients-2021-veterinary-scholarships/\">American Kennel Club (AKC) Veterinary Outreach Scholarships</a>: For vet students who have participated in AKC events and programs; depending on the sponsor, students might be awarded up to $10,000</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/merck-animal-health-scholarship/\">Merck Animal Health Veterinary Student Scholarship Program</a>: Awards $5,000 scholarships to second- and third-year vet students with financial need</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/national-regional-scholarships/\">The American Veterinary Medical Foundation scholarships</a>: Offers a list of available scholarships and requirements for vet students</li></ul><h3>2. Fill out the FAFSA</h3><p>Fill out the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> before the deadline. For the 2025-26 academic year, you have until June 30, 2026. Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine what federal student loans and other financial aid you qualify for. Keep in mind that some aid is given on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's a good idea to submit the FAFSA as early as possible.</p><p>You might also qualify for school-based scholarships depending on your FAFSA results.</p><h3>3. Get a job or qualify for a work-study program</h3><p>Working during school could help you cover some of your school expenses. If you have financial need, you might qualify for the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study program</a>, which provides part-time <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">jobs for college students</a>.</p><p>These jobs are often on campus, though in some cases, you might work for a private nonprofit or for-profit employer that has partnered with your school.</p><h3>4. Apply for federal student loans</h3><p>If you need to borrow for school, it's usually best to rely on federal student loans first. This is because these loans come with federal benefits and protections, such as access to income-driven repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs.</p><p>There are two main types of federal student loans that vet school students might qualify for:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized loans:</strong> These loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students regardless of financial need. Unlike undergraduate subsidized loans, you're responsible for all of the interest that accrues on unsubsidized loans.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans:</strong> These loans are available to students who want to pay for grad school or a professional program. Keep in mind, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">grad PLUS loans</a> usually come with higher interest rates than other federal loans. They also require a credit check.</li></ul><p>After you submit the FAFSA, your school will send you a financial aid award letter detailing what federal student loans and other financial aid you're eligible for. You can then decide which aid you'd like to accept.</p><h3>5. Apply for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program</h3><p>Check into the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) after graduation. It's a federal program designed to help with a national shortage of veterinarians in rural and agricultural areas. Specialized vets focus on food animals, like cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry.</p><p>The VMLRP offers up to $40,000 per year toward eligible government and commercial student loan repayment to eligible veterinarians in return for their service in high-priority veterinary shortages for three years. These are the requirements:</p><ul><li>Have at least $15,000 in qualified veterinary educational loan debt</li><li>Hold a DVM (or equivalent) from an accredited school</li><li>Start within 90 days of award notification in a designated veterinary shortage situation</li><li>Meet all <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.9\">other requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.10\">regulations</a></li></ul><h3>6. Private loans for vet school</h3><p>After you've exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> could help fill any financial gaps left over. While these loans don't come with federal protections, they do offer some benefits of their own - for example, you can apply at any time, and you might be able to borrow more than you'd get with a federal loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable:898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable","id":"898","refiLenders":[],"isLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogLenderType","name":"Abe","slug":"abe","variableRate":true,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"660","loanTerms":"5, 7, 10, 15, 20","loanAmount":"$1,000 up to school-certified cost of attendance (aggregate $225,000 limit)","discounts":"Autopay, Good Payment Behavior","cosignerRelease":"12 months","repaymentOptions":"Full deferral, immediate, fixed/flat, and interest only","fees":"None","degrees":"Undergraduate, graduate, certificate, advanced degrees","vertical":"inschool","lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/05cbce1b-b2d8-4403-9a7b-233da5a6d1b2","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.3,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/abe-student-loans-review","bestFor":"Best for Payment Relief Options","expertInsights":"<p>Few private lenders match the borrower protections Abe offers.

The amount that accrues depends on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-high-interest-rate\">interest rate</a>, which can vary by loan type (federal or private) or degree type (undergraduate or graduate).&nbsp;</p><p>“Interest rates on federal student loans are the same for all borrowers, while interest rates on private student loans may vary depending on the credit score of the borrower and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner</a>, if any,” says Mark Kantrowitz, an education financing expert and author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>In most cases, student loan interest accrues daily. Lenders use a formula that multiplies your principal balance and interest rate, then divides by 365.25 (the number of days in a year, accounting for leap years). Unlike some other types of loans, student loans don’t compound interest in the traditional sense.&nbsp;</p><h2>Student loan interest calculation formula</h2><p>The daily student loan interest formula is:</p><p><strong>(Current principal balance × interest rate) ÷ 365.25 = Daily interest accrual</strong></p><p>Here’s an example of how to calculate interest on student loans for a principal balance of $50,000 on a loan with a 7% interest rate:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Convert the interest rate to a decimal:</strong>&nbsp;You can convert the interest rate percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100. In this case, it would be 7/100, which equals 0.07. Once you have that, you can do the full student loan interest calculation.</li><li><strong>Calculate daily interest:</strong> (50,000 × 0.07) ÷ 365.25 = $9.58 daily interest&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Multiply days between payments for monthly interest:</strong>&nbsp;Usually, you have about 30 days between payments. With this example, you’d pay $287.40 (9.58 x 30 = 287.4) per month in interest.</li></ol><h2>How interest accrues on federal vs. private student loans</h2><p>Interest accrues similarly for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/hidden-costs-federal-direct-unsubsidized-student-loans\">federal student loans</a> and private student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>“Interestingly, both federal student loans and most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> accrue interest on a simple interest basis,” says Glenn Sanger-Hodgson, certified student loan professional (CSLP) and founder of Shonan Gold Financial LLC.&nbsp;</p><p>“This means that interest accrues in a separate ‘bucket,’ so to speak, from the principal, and only ever gets added to the principal through a process called capitalization,” he explains. “When borrowers make payments, they are usually applied to any outstanding interest first, and once that’s been paid down, any remaining amount is applied to the principal.”</p><p>However, it’s important to note that some private student loan lenders may use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">compound interest formula</a>. With compound interest, interest is charged on the principal and the unpaid interest, causing it to add up fast. Contact your lender to find out how interest accrues and any capitalization rules.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is student loan interest capitalization?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">Student loan interest capitalization</a> is when unpaid interest is added to your principal balance. That increases your outstanding balance, and you then pay interest on that higher amount. While capitalization can still occur in certain cases, policy changes in recent years have limited how often it happens with federal student loans.</p><p>“On federal student loans, there was a push a few years ago to reduce the number of triggers for interest capitalization,” says Sanger-Hodgson. “Now interest only capitalizes after the end of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> on an unsubsidized loan, or if you are on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan</a> and either no longer have a partial financial hardship or you switch to another plan.”</p><p>That is the case for Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program loans, both managed by the Department of Education. If you have FFEL program loans that aren’t managed by the Department of Education, unpaid interest may capitalize after a grace period or deferment on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">unsubsidized loan</a>, after a forbearance, or if you leave or no longer qualify for the IBR Plan.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324922":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324922","content":"<h2>Understanding compound interest on student loans</h2><p>While most student loans use simple interest, some <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loan rates</a> may involve compound interest, which works differently.</p><p>Instead of just calculating interest on your original balance, it's calculated on the total balance, including any unpaid interest from the previous day. For example, if your loan balance is $10,000 with a daily interest rate of 0.013%, you'll start by accruing $1.30 in interest. The next day, interest is calculated on $10,001.30, so you're paying interest on interest, which increases your costs over time.</p><p>Since compound interest builds off of itself, it's generally more expensive than a simple interest loan. Additionally, many private loans may have variable interest rates, which can change based on market conditions.

However, paying the interest that accrues in school can help you lower costs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Borrowers who are not pursuing a federal public student loan forgiveness program can make interest-only payments while in school to decrease interest accumulation,” says Kelly Reddy-Heffner, a certified financial planner (CFP) at Steel City Wealth Collaborative.</p><h3>Set up autopay&nbsp;</h3><p>You could reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percentage points by signing up for autopay.

If you get a tax refund, raise, birthday money, or other windfall, consider putting more toward your debt.&nbsp;</p><h3>Review your repayment options&nbsp;</h3><p>The student loan landscape is poised for major changes. Borrowers may want to review their repayment options, as there will be an interest benefit on a new plan.&nbsp;</p><p>“Another way to reduce how much interest accrues is by enrolling in a repayment plan that features an unpaid interest subsidy,” says Sanger-Hodgson. “Currently, no active plans offer this, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/repayment-assistance-plan\">Repayment Assistance Plan</a>, which should be available to borrowers by July 1, 2026, will include this feature.

If you want to reduce your long-term borrowing costs, consider paying off the interest during your grace period, even though it's not required.&nbsp;</p><h2>What happens when the grace period ends?</h2><p>The end of the grace period is when student loan repayment starts. If you have federal student loans, your servicer will automatically place you on the Standard Repayment Plan. However, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/best-student-loan-repayment-plan\">choose a different repayment plan</a> at any time.&nbsp;</p><p>“Students should review their repayment options and work with their loan servicer to select a repayment plan that best fits their budget,” says Cathy Mueller, executive director of Mapping Your Future, a nonprofit organization that provides college, career, and financial-aid education. “We strongly recommend borrowers reevaluate their repayment plan every year to determine if they're on the best plan based on their current financial situation.”</p><p>For federal student loans, you'll receive your repayment schedule at least 30 days before your first student loan payment is due. You'll also get your first bill at least 21 days before the payment due date. This can vary if you have a private lender. Make sure your loan servicer has your updated contact information so you don't miss any communications.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also set up online accounts with your student loan servicers, where you'll manage your loans and make payments.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you fail to begin making payments when required, you'll enter delinquency and eventually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/defaulting-on-student-loans\">default</a>,” warns Farrington.</p><p>Consider using autopay, which lets your servicer automatically withdraw payments from your bank account each month and can help ensure you don't miss any payments. Plus, you'll typically receive a 0.25 percentage point discount on your interest rate.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to use your grace period wisely</h2><p>While it may be tempting to delay repayment of your student loans for as long as possible, your grace period is an opportunity to prepare for repayment. Some steps you can take include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Choose a repayment plan:</strong>&nbsp;Federal student loans are currently eligible for various repayment plans, including the Standard Plan, Extended Plan, Graduated Plan, and income-driven repayment.

There are a few key factors to consider, including the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Loan type:&nbsp;</strong>Many borrowers have both federal and private student loans. Typically, private student loans have fewer borrower protections than federal loans, so it usually makes sense to pay off private loans first.</li><li><strong>Interest rate:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to save as much money as possible, you should prioritize paying off your loans with the highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-interest-rate\">interest rate</a> first.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan balance:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to score quick wins and reduce the number of loans you're paying fast, it makes sense to first focus on paying off your student loans with the lowest balance.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Forgiveness or income-driven repayment (IDR):&nbsp;</strong> Borrowers with federal student loans may have access to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">IDR</a> plans and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">forgiveness</a> options. IDR plans create more room in your budget, while forgiveness programs reduce the total amount you have to repay. If you can cap payments at a small percentage of income and earn forgiveness, it may not make sense to pay off these loans early.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Debt avalanche vs. debt snowball</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-avalanche-method\">debt avalanche</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-snowball-method\">debt snowball</a> method are two popular approaches to debt payoff that you should consider when repaying your student loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the debt avalanche is the most mathematically efficient plan, the debt snowball method offers quick wins to help you stay motivated.&nbsp;</p><p>Both methods can work. But the right one for you varies based on your situation, so consider the key differences between the debt avalanche vs. snowball to decide which makes sense.&nbsp;</p><h3>When it makes sense to pay off the highest-interest student loans first</h3><p>If you follow the debt avalanche method, you'll work on paying off your loan with the highest interest rate first. After you’ve eliminated that debt, put any money you have available for extra payments toward the loan with the next highest rate until you're debt-free.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this method focuses on the most expensive debts first, it can save you the most on interest over your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/how-long-to-pay-off\">student loan repayment period</a>. If you are motivated by saving as much money as possible, the avalanche method is the better choice.</p><h3>When it makes sense to pay off smaller student loan balances first</h3><p>In contrast, the debt snowball method involves paying off your loans with the smallest balance first.&nbsp;</p><p>As you pay off smaller debts, you’ll work your way up to paying off your larger ones. The money you have available for debt repayment grows as you eliminate debts and the attached minimum monthly payments, so you gain momentum over time.&nbsp;</p><p>This method focuses on eliminating each individual loan from your life as quickly as possible. Although it’s not as mathematically efficient, many borrowers stay more motivated due to the quick wins along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you're the kind of person who's impatient and needs to see progress, or you get discouraged, then the snowball method is better than nothing,” says Howard Dvorkin, CPA and Chairman of Debt.com. Dvorkin continues, “But if you can keep your eye on the prize, go avalanche all the way.”</p><h2>Federal vs private student loans: Which should come first?</h2><p>The type of loans you have — federal, private, or both —also affects which student loan payoff strategy makes sense for you.</p><p>“Almost always, federal loans have lower overall interest rates,” says Dvorkin. “So focus on private loans first. This is especially true if your private loans come with variable interest rates. Those rates can fluctuate, while federal loans are locked in – once you see that number, it doesn’t ever change.”</p><p>Additionally, federal student loans offer borrower protections that private loans lack, including income-driven repayment and loan forgiveness opportunities. It makes sense to prioritize paying off private student loans that don't provide these benefits.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:321202":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"321202","content":"<h2>How forgiveness and repayment plans affect payoff strategy</h2><p>If you have federal student loans, the possibility of loan forgiveness affects whether you should try to repay your debt early.&nbsp;</p><p>There are several options to get federal student loan debt forgiven, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or forgiveness after making a certain number of payments on one of several income-driven repayment (IDR) plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a closer look at how these options could impact your repayment plans.&nbsp;</p><h3>Public Service Loan Forgiveness</h3><p>If you are eligible for loan forgiveness through PSLF, making extra payments toward eligible loans may not make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>If your end goal is to have the loan balance forgiven, you’ll generally want to minimize the amount you pay over time. Instead, redirect any extra money toward repaying other debts or growing your savings.&nbsp;</p><h3>Income-driven repayment plans</h3><p>It also doesn't make sense to make extra payments on your loans if you're signed up for an income-driven repayment plan and hoping to get your loans forgiven over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Under an IDR plan, eligible borrowers see their monthly payment adjusted based on their income. After 20 to 25 years of qualifying repayments, any remaining loan balance is forgiven.&nbsp;</p><p>For those with a relatively low income and a large loan balance, aggressively paying down IDR-eligible loans may not reduce your total cost and could reduce the amount of debt forgiven in the future. Instead of sending extra money towards debts that are going to eventually disappear, use your available funds to pay down other loans, like private loans that don’t qualify for forgiveness&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan who expect their income to go up during the repayment term might find that paying extra toward federal loans does make sense. After all, a higher income will lead to a higher payment, which could mean you don't end up getting your debt forgiven in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>As you decide on your repayment plan with PSLF and IDR options in play, the key is to determine if qualifying for forgiveness is realistic. This will help you decide whether to pay off your loans ASAP to save on interest, or to try to pay as little as possible until your debt can be wiped clean. You’ll need to match up your goals with your debt repayment choices.&nbsp;</p><h2>How refinancing can help simplify repayment</h2><p>If you're juggling multiple loans and are interested in figuring out how to pay off student loans faster, refinancing is worth considering.&nbsp;</p><p>When you refinance, you can combine multiple loans into a single loan with one monthly payment. Plus, it’s often possible to lock in a lower interest rate when you refinance, which can save you money on interest during your repayment period.&nbsp;</p><p>However, refinancing isn't right for everyone. It's more likely to be the best student loan repayment strategy for those with private student loans, not federal loans.</p><p>“Borrowers with federal student loans should keep in mind that refinancing federal loans to private loans would eliminate the protections offered by the government, which is not always in their best interest,” says Leslie Tayne, Founder and Head Attorney at Tayne Law Group.&nbsp;</p><p>“Also, it’s important to read the fine print when refinancing,” continues Tayne. “There can be hidden fees, such as early payoff fees, initial loan fees, etc. So do the math to be sure you are really saving money when refinancing.”</p><p>If you are interested in refinancing, make sure to compare options across multiple lenders.

Removing money from your 401(k) without the intention of paying it back is a 401(k) withdrawal, also referred to as a distribution. These funds remain permanently removed from your account.&nbsp;</p><p>401(k) withdrawals are usually subject to a tax penalty of 10% if you’re under 59½ plus income tax. But there are exceptions. For example, you can take a 401(k) hardship withdrawal — a maximum of $1,000 — penalty-free once annually to pay for an emergency personal expense. Some plans also allow withdrawals for qualified birth, adoption, or medical expenses. Though you may avoid an early withdrawal penalty in these cases, your withdrawal would still be taxable according to your income tax rate.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does a 401(k) loan work?</h2><p>A 401(k) loan has specific rules on borrowing limits and repayments. Understanding the risks of borrowing against your 401(k) can help you decide if it’s a good option.</p><h3>Policies</h3><p>Most 401(k) policies differ between companies. “Some companies allow multiple loans at once, others cap borrowing at one loan at a time,” says Chris Heerlein, chief executive officer of REAP Financial. Your policy’s loan interest rate and repayment terms can vary from one employer to the next, too. Before borrowing, read your policy and ask your employer about restrictions on using your loan funds and what happens with your loan if you take a leave of absence or leave the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Borrowing limits</h3><p>The most you can borrow from a 401(k) plan is $50,000. But you can’t borrow this amount unless you have at least $100,000 vested in your account. This is because you're limited to borrow up to half of your vested balance. The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000. For example, if you only have $15,000 vested in your 401(k), you could borrow up to $10,000.&nbsp;</p><p>These borrowing limits are the same even if your 401(k) plan allows multiple loans at once.&nbsp;</p><p>Say you have a vested 401(k) balance of $60,000. Per the IRS, you’d be allowed to borrow up to $30,000, or 50% of your vested balance. (Keep in mind, your 401(k) plan would need to allow 401(k) loans.)&nbsp;</p><p>Let's also say that you already took out a loan for $20,000 and have repaid $10,000 of it (you still owe $10,000). Now, you want to borrow a second 401(k) loan. You’d be allowed to borrow up to $20,000, since half of your vested balance is $30,000, and the two loans would total $30,000.</p><h3>401(k) loan interest rate and fees</h3><p>Some 401(k) plans charge fees for your loan. This may be a one-time fee for establishing your loan, usually between $50 and $100. Some plan administrators may also charge a loan application fee and an annual maintenance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also pay interest on a 401(k) loan based on the current prime rate. However, the interest you pay goes back into your account. “Essentially, the interest payment is like moving money from your left pocket to your right pocket,” says Andrew Hall, certified financial planner, wealth advisor, and vice president of Farther, a wealth management platform.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267118":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267118","content":"<h3>Repayment&nbsp;</h3><p>Like other types of loans, you’ll repay a 401(k) loan over time with interest. Most plans require you to repay your loan in full within five years, although your repayment term may be extended if you’re using the funds to buy a home as your primary residence. You’ll also need to make payments at least once per quarter.&nbsp;</p><h3>Changing jobs</h3><p>If you leave your job when you have an outstanding 401(k) loan, you’ll need to repay the loan in full. This can happen if you quit or get terminated. If you can’t pay it off, your employer will treat it as a 401(k) withdrawal, meaning you’ll be taxed and charged the 10% distribution penalty if you’re under the age of 59½. For example, you may have up to 90 days after your termination date to pay back the outstanding balance in full.</p><h3>Retirement growth</h3><p>When you take out a 401(k) loan, the amount borrowed does not participate in market gains (or losses). “While you’re technically borrowing from yourself, the real cost is lost growth,” says Heerlein, who had a client take out a $30,000 401(k) loan and pay it back over five years. “The market performed well during that period, and had they left the money invested, it could have grown by tens of thousands. They repaid the loan, but the lost compounding set them back years.”</p><p>Plus, some plans may not allow you to contribute to your 401(k) while you have an outstanding loan. If this is the case and your plan includes employer-matching contributions, you could also lose out on thousands of dollars of “free” money (contributed by your employer) over the term of your 401(k) loan.&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, borrowing from your 401(k) can provide short-term financial relief but potentially leave you without as much of a retirement cushion later on.</p><h3>Credit impact&nbsp;</h3><p>A 401(k) loan doesn’t require a credit check, and neither the loan itself nor your payments will be reported to credit bureaus. Even if you don’t repay the loan, it won’t appear on your credit report. So, in terms of impacting your credit, a 401(k) loan carries little risk.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267122","content":"<h3>401(k) loans vs personal loans</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> doesn’t affect your retirement savings like a 401(k) loan.

Many plans have online self-service portals to submit a digital application, but yours may require a paper application.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review loan terms:</strong> Read the loan agreement to understand your loan’s fees, interest rate, and repayment terms.

Personal loans are often available up to $50,000, depending on the lender, but some offer loans up to $100,000 or more, if you can qualify.

This involves a soft credit check (so no harm to your score) and a few minutes of your time. You won't get loan offers, but lenders will reveal what they <i>might</i> offer based on basic info you input and the soft credit pull. (When you apply, most lenders conduct a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">hard credit pull</a> that could ding your score for up to one year.)</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li><strong>Compare APRs:</strong>&nbsp;APR, or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, considers both the interest rate and any upfront fees to give a true measure of your overall borrowing costs per year for any particular loan. Personal loan lenders are required to advertise APR ranges, so this comparison is relatively easy. APRs for personal loans typically range from 6.49% to 35.99%.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms:</strong> Most lenders offer repayment terms <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">between 2 and 5 years</a>, with some offering 7-year repayment terms and longer. A longer repayment term can help you afford a large loan amount, while a shorter term can save you money on interest.</li><li><strong>Look at loan amounts:</strong> Many lenders offer loans up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a>. A few, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a>, offer loans as large as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a>.

However, if <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">you want to&nbsp;avoid an origination fee</a> entirely, choose a lender that doesn’t charge them, ever — like LightStream, Discover, or Citi.</li><li><strong>Look at loan purposes:</strong> Some lenders approve a <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">wide range of loan purposes</a>, such as LightStream, which offers personal loans for home improvement, debt consolidation, boat or RV purchases, adoption expenses, medical bills, and more.

Higher scores typically equate to lower rates and vice versa.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income:</strong> A high income can help you get a low rate, sometimes even if your credit isn’t perfect.

There are two popular debt repayment methods, each with its own merits: the debt avalanche method and the debt snowball method.</p><h3>Debt avalanche</h3><p>The debt avalanche method pays off your debts one by one according to their interest rates. Here’s how it works:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li>Organize your debts according to interest rate, from highest to lowest.</li><li>Make minimum payments on all your debts. Put any extra cash you can afford toward the debt with the highest interest rate until it’s paid off.</li><li>When the first debt is gone, put the money you would have paid toward it — plus any extra — toward the next debt on your list. Repeat until all the debt is gone.</li></ol><p>This method ends up saving you money in the long run because you’re getting rid of your highest-interest debt first — which costs the most, relative to your balance. However, it also takes longer to pay off your debt.</p><h3>Debt snowball</h3><p>The debt snowball method, on the other hand, has you pay off your debts according to balance. It works like this:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li>Organize your debts according to balance — from smallest to largest.</li><li>Make minimum payments on all your debts. Put any extra cash you can afford toward your smallest debt until it’s paid off.</li><li>When the first debt is gone, put the money you would have paid toward it — plus any extra — toward the next debt on your list. Continue until all the debt is gone.</li></ol><p>This method isn’t the most cost-effective, but it may be the easiest to stick to. By paying off the smallest balance first, you can celebrate a quick win and use that momentum to keep yourself going.</p><h2>Other alternatives</h2><p>If the above tactics aren’t enough to make a significant dent in your debt, you’re not out of options. You can always get support with the alternatives below:</p><ul><li><strong>Use credit counseling services: </strong>Typically employed by nonprofit organizations, credit counselors can help you create a personalized budget and debt payoff plan. They may even set you up with a debt management program (more below), which can help you save on fees and interest. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.nfcc.org/\">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a> to connect with a counselor.</li><li><strong>Consider a debt management program: </strong>A credit counselor may help you negotiate lower monthly payments as part of a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>. You’ll give your monthly debt payments to a credit counselor, and they’ll handle the payment to creditors on your behalf — potentially for a small fee.</li><li><strong>Explore bankruptcy as a last resort: </strong>Bankruptcy isn’t ideal, but it’s something to consider when you’ve run out of other options. Bankruptcy is a legal process that can help give you a clean slate, by either selling your assets to repay debts or setting up a repayment plan. While bankruptcy can provide a fresh start for some, it severely hurts your credit for 7 to 10 years and can make borrowing more difficult in the future.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Compare: </strong></i><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-bankruptcy\"><i>Debt Consolidation vs. Bankruptcy: How To Choose</i></a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:602":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"602","content":"<p>Debt consolidation can be an effective tool to manage your debt by reducing the amount of time and money it takes you to pay it off.

In an optimal scenario, you will be able to consolidate high-interest debt into a loan with a lower interest rate, saving you money in the long run. A common form of debt consolidation is using a personal loan to pay off <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/how-much-credit-card-debt-too-much\">credit card debt</a>.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a simple example to see how a personal loan could be a highly beneficial financial move. Say you have two credit cards: one with a balance of $2,000, and one with a balance of $2,500. They both charge roughly the average interest rate on credit cards of 20%, per <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TERMCBCCALLNS\">Federal Reserve data from May 2023</a>.</p><p>Now let’s say you have a very good credit score of 750 and qualify for a 3-year loan for $4,500 at an interest rate of 12%. You receive that money and use it to pay off your credit cards.</p><p>As a result, you have a $0 balance for both credit cards and no longer have to worry about the compounding interest. Instead, you have a <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-a-personal-loan\">personal loan</a> with a monthly payment of roughly $150 that will be completely paid off in three years.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">What Is Debt Consolidation?</a></p><h2>Compare personal loans for debt consolidation</h2>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTableByVertical:70":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTableByVertical","id":"70","ctaType":"hybridCta","lenders":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLendersByVertical","plLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogPersonalLoanLenderType","name":"LightStream","slug":"lightstream","variableRate":false,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"700","loanTerms":"2 - 7","loanAmount":"$5000 to $100000","discounts":"Autopay","allowCosigner":"No","prepaymentPenalty":"None","unsuccessfulPaymentFee":"None","checkProcessingFee":"None","originationFee":"None","lateFee":"None","timeToFund":"As soon as the same business day","vertical":"personal","lenderDirectUrl":"http://www.lightstream.com/?fact=37170","enableDirectUrl":true,"lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/bee5acc1-03a6-4500-a253-11433046c96f","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.9,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review","bestFor":"Best overall","expertInsights":"","averageFicoCreditScore":null,"averageFundingTime":null,"labelCta":null,"subtextCta":null,"directToLender":null,"ficoTable":[],"moreDetails":{"__typename":"moreDetailsType","details":[{"__typename":"detailsType","title":"Overview","textContent":"<p>LightStream is one of three Credible partner lenders to offer loan amounts up to $100,000, which makes it ideal for financing large expenses.

Many lenders <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">charge origination fees</a>, which are typically a percentage of your total loan amount — often ranging from 1% to 8%. These fees are deducted before you receive your loan, meaning you might need to borrow more than expected just to cover the cost of consolidation.</li><li><strong>Longer-term interest costs: </strong>While debt consolidation may reduce your monthly payments, it often extends the repayment period.

Let's take a look at some of the most common:</p><ul><li><strong>Secured personal loan:</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loan</a> may be “secured” by a house or a car, meaning that if you don't make timely payments on your loan, your car may be repossessed or the lender could place a lien or foreclose on your home. While you may lose that asset if you don't make your payments, secured loans often offer lower rates than unsecured personal loans.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\"><strong>Unsecured personal loan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These personal loans are not backed or \"secured\" by your assets. So, you won't lose your possessions if you don't make your payments, although your credit score will be impacted and late payment fees will still apply. Because you aren't offering collateral, having a good credit score is important for getting a low interest rate.</li><li><strong>Balance transfer credit cards:</strong> Some credit cards specifically cater to people looking to consolidate their debt. Generally, these cards offer a <a href=\"https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26750746&amp;s1=&amp;utm_source=credible_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fdebt-consolidation-loans%2Fhow-does-debt-consolidation-work\">0% interest rate</a> for a period of time, then charge you a balance transfer fee that's a percentage of the total amount you transfer over. However, it's important to pay off your balance before the introductory interest rate expires, or you could be right back where you started, with high-interest credit card debt to pay off.</li><li><strong>Peer-to-peer loan:</strong> These loans are from individuals like yourself who will lend you the money you need and then collect the interest on your payments. Often, <a href=\"/personal-loan/peer-to-peer-lending\">peer-to-peer loans</a> are offered via websites that cater to borrowers who have had difficulty obtaining a personal loan from traditional lenders.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\"><strong>Home equity loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you own a home and have a good amount of equity in your home, this kind of loan may be a good option for you. This is a secured loan, so you have the possibility of losing your home if you default on your loan. Home equity loans generally have attractive fixed interest rates, according to the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-home-equity-loan-en-106/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) — though you'll also want to make sure you understand any additional fees that you might incur.</li><li><strong>Home equity line of credit (HELOC):</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">HELOC</a> is a form of secured, revolving debt. Revolving debt works like a credit card, where you can borrow repeatedly up to a certain amount. The CFPB notes that since HELOCs usually have variable interest rates (which can fluctuate due to market conditions), and if your home value falls for whatever reason, your creditor could limit your credit.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan-vs-personal-loan\"><strong>401(k) loan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some 401(k) plans will allow you to borrow from your own account. You are usually only allowed to borrow up to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-loans#:~:text=The%20maximum%20amount%20a%20participant,may%20borrow%20up%20to%20%2410%2C000.\">50% of your vested balance</a>.

The idea behind this strategy is that you can see results faster with larger payments going to your smallest debt, giving you a win faster and building momentum — and motivation.

When you've paid off that highest-interest debt, move to the next highest.</p><h3>Increasing your income</h3><p>This is one of the best ways to get ahead financially, but of course, it's easier said than done. Look for higher-paying jobs or consider taking on a gig or freelance work and putting any extra money you make toward your debts.</p><p>Gig and freelance work often have associated taxes and costs — such as the cost of gas and car maintenance if you drive for a ride-hailing app — so make sure you're planning for those costs as well.</p><h3>Negotiating with your lender</h3><p>Often, lenders will understand when you're struggling and unable to make your payments. Reach out to your lender and see if they'll work with you to make your debt more manageable.</p><p>You can ask that they lower your monthly payment, reduce your interest rate, waive fees, or change your payment's due date, according to the CFPB.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/negotiate-credit-card-debt\">How To Negotiate Credit Card Debt: A Guide</a></p><h2>How to qualify for a debt consolidation loan</h2><ul><li><strong>Boost your credit score:</strong> If you have a <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\">great credit score</a>, you will usually qualify for a better loan because lenders see you as trustworthy.

Understand how term length affects your loan</h2><p>Personal loan term lengths have a big impact on several aspects of your loan repayment:</p><ul><li><strong>Monthly payment:</strong> Loans with shorter repayment terms have higher monthly payments, while loans with longer repayment terms tend to have lower monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Interest rate:</strong> Generally speaking, loans with longer repayment terms have higher interest rates than loans with shorter terms. Lenders tend to raise interest rates on long-term loans because longer repayment terms increase the risk of default.</li><li><strong>Interest paid:</strong> Your term length plays a crucial role in how much interest you pay. The longer your term, the more interest you'll pay over time.</li></ul><h3>How term length affects repayment costs</h3><p>Lenders typically offer several different term lengths. As noted, the longer your repayment term, the higher your loan's APR (in most cases). And since you'd pay interest over a longer period of time (with a longer repayment term), that further increases the loan's cost.</p><p>The chart below shows APRs and estimated interest costs of three loan terms for a $10,000 loan:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:286090":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"286090","content":"<p>In this case, choosing a five-year loan would cut your monthly payment by almost half compared to a two-year term.

Ensure you weigh your budget, the cost of borrowing the money, and your forecasted financial goals.”</p><h2>4. Know what to consider when choosing your term length</h2><p>Choosing a personal loan term length involves several considerations that can impact your short- and long-term financial health.</p><h3>Loan amount</h3><p>Choosing the right loan amount is an important part of keeping your monthly payment and total interest costs low. If you're getting a personal loan for debt consolidation, simply add up your various loan and credit balances and request a loan amount equal to the sum of your balances.</p><p>However, if you're using your loan for a home improvement project — or any other project with potentially unknown or surprise costs — consider adding 5% to 10% more to the amount.</p><h3>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h3><p>Your loan's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">APR</a> is a percentage that accounts for the loan's interest rate plus any upfront fees the lender charges. For example, a loan with an origination fee will have an APR that's higher than its interest rate.</p><p>Generally speaking, you want a loan without an origination fee — in this case, the APR would be equal to the loan's interest rate. An origination fee can reduce the amount you receive if it's taken out upfront from the loan amount.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:286098":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"286098","content":"<h3>Monthly payments</h3><p>Your monthly payment directly impacts your monthly budget, so consider how much of a monthly payment you can honestly afford. Choosing a loan with the lowest monthly payment might give you the most budget breathing room each month, but choosing a slightly higher monthly payment could result in significant interest savings over the life of the loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:286102":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"286102","content":"<h3>Total interest costs</h3><p>Looking at total interest costs is a long-term way to understand the impact of your loan. The low monthly payments that long-term loans offer can be hard to pass up. However, a longer term means you're making many more interest payments, which adds up to a higher total cost.</p><p>As you compare terms, try to find the borrowing sweet spot that offers a balance between the lowest monthly payments and the lowest total interest.</p><h3>Present and future budget</h3><p>Another consideration is how your budget could change over time.</p><p>For example, your income could dip considerably if you're working a contract job that concludes at the end of the year. If that's you, then you'll need to consider how you'll cover your monthly payment if you can't find a job immediately after your contract ends.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have a raise coming soon that will allow you to make bigger monthly payments, you may want to choose a shorter repayment term with monthly payments that your raise will offset.</p><p>Ask yourself the following budgeting and income questions:</p><ol><li>Is your partner starting a new job soon that will increase your household income?</li><li>Are your bills set to increase soon because of a life event like a marriage or the birth of a child?</li><li>Are any of your insurance premiums set to increase soon?</li><li>Does your financial plan include upcoming increases to the amount you contribute to your retirement or investment accounts?</li><li>Are any payment plans you're making for past bills coming to an end soon?</li><li>Where are you at in your short-term and long-term financial plans?</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296114":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296114","content":"<p>Having good credit can make it easier to get approved for a personal loan and qualify for a low interest rate.

By using an online marketplace like Credible, you can get quotes from several lenders at once and compare APRs, fees, and repayment terms. Just remember two important distinctions:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Prequalification is an estimate, not an offer of credit. The APR, terms, and fees in a loan offer might differ from prequalified quotes.&nbsp;</li><li>Prequalification involves a soft credit inquiry that won’t affect your credit score, but applying for a loan typically requires a hard credit inquiry that could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for up to a year.</li></ul><p>Note that some lenders have minimum credit score and income requirements, although they’re not always disclosed.

Pick a loan option</h3><p>After comparing lenders, choose the loan option that offers the best combination of overall interest costs and affordable monthly payments. Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to see how the length of the repayment term affects the size of your monthly payment and interest costs over the life of the loan.

Lenders are required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to display APR when advertising rates, so borrowing costs are generally transparent. However, be sure to check for other fees, such as late fees. Although most lenders don’t charge prepayment penalties for paying off a loan early, it never hurts to check the fine print.</li><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Loan amounts vary between lenders. Make sure the lender offers the loan amount you need. Note that you might qualify for a larger loan amount with a lender that offers longer repayment terms relative to one that doesn’t.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> Look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> offered by lenders you are considering. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less interest overall. Longer terms lower monthly costs but increase the total interest paid.</li><li><strong>Customer service:</strong> Choose a lender with a reputation for providing excellent customer support. You want a lender that will be helpful and responsive if you have questions or issues with your loan.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> are valuable resources for researching how well lenders and other businesses treat their customers.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>Will a personal loan boost my credit score?</h2><p>Yes, a personal loan can increase your credit score over time if managed responsibly. Here are a few key ways that getting a personal loan, and repaying it, can help your score:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining a positive payment history:</strong> Payment history is the largest factor in determining your FICO score (35%). Making each loan payment helps strengthen your record of paying on time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Amount of debt owed:</strong>&nbsp;This category accounts for 30% of your FICO score, making it the second-most influential factor after payment history. Although taking out a personal loan increases your total debt, paying off the loan gradually reduces it. FICO looks at debt owed on all your accounts, so it’s important to fulfill your other obligations in addition to the loan.</li><li><strong>Lowering your credit utilization ratio:</strong> Your credit utilization is the amount you owe on revolving credit lines, such as credit cards, compared to your credit limits. If you use a personal loan to&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">consolidate credit card debt</a>, you could reduce your credit utilization ratio and see improvements to your credit score within one month.</li><li><strong>Diversifying your credit mix:</strong> Lenders like to see that you can handle multiple types of credit. Adding a new personal loan could improve your credit mix, which accounts for 10% of your FICO score, especially if you don't have another type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a> on your credit report.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296158":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296158","content":"<h2>Alternatives to personal loans&nbsp;</h2><p>Although a personal loan can be very useful, it’s not a Swiss army knife.

You can get an unsecured line of credit from some banks, for example. Once you're approved, you can draw from it as needed during the draw period. Lines of credit may have a defined draw period and repayment period or a continuous draw period:</p><ul><li><strong>Draw period:</strong> The time during which you can use the line of credit. Interest-only payments may be required.</li><li><strong>Repayment period:</strong>&nbsp;Once the repayment period begins, you can no longer use the credit line and will pay off the balance in installments over a period of years.</li><li><strong>Continuous draw period:</strong>&nbsp;You can keep using the line of credit, similar to a credit card.</li></ul><p>Lines of credit typically have variable interest rates. How large a credit line you qualify for will depend on your credit, income, and current debt.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>Some banks and lenders offer a specific product called a home equity line of credit (HELOC) that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. Lenders typically require that you have at least 20% available equity to qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>A HELOC may have a lower variable APR and higher credit line available and may offer longer repayment terms than other lines of credit. How large a credit line you qualify for will depend on the amount of equity you have in your home, your credit, income, and current debt.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296162":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296162","content":"<h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>Like a HELOC, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> lets you tap your home's equity, and the home is used as collateral.

The average credit card interest rate is over 21%, according to the Federal Reserve, and interest on any unpaid balance can add up quickly. However, there are a few instances when using a credit card could be a better option:</p><ol><li><strong>You can qualify for a 0% APR promotion:</strong> If you have good credit, you might be eligible for a&nbsp;card with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR</a> on new purchases and balance transfers. Keep in mind that transfers often come with a fee from 3% to 5%. Zero APR offers may last from 6 to 21 months or more. If you can pay off the balance within that time, you can essentially get an interest-free loan. However, the card’s regular APR applies after the promotional period ends.</li><li><strong>You can pay off the balance within the card's grace period:</strong> Credit cards typically have a grace period of one billing cycle, during which time you won't be charged interest on purchases. If you can't pay your balance within the grace period, the purchase will be charged interest at the card's standard APR.</li><li><strong>You plan to refinance credit card debt:</strong> If you're eligible for a 0% APR promotion but can't pay off the balance within the promotional period, you might consider using a personal loan to refinance the debt before the APR adjusts. This is not necessarily recommended since there's no guarantee you'll be able to qualify for debt consolidation.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296166":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296166","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated <strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best loans for good credit.

Credit unions can be a good fit if you prefer to work with a brick-and-mortar lender (many credit unions have physical locations) and want competitive rates.</p><h3>Your brokerage</h3><p>Like a savings- or CD-secured loan, you may be eligible to borrow against non-retirement assets in your brokerage account. However, unlike unsecured and secured personal loans, brokerages typically extend a line of credit (as opposed to an <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a>) backed by your securities.</p><p>The main advantage is that you can borrow as needed.

Small differences in interest rates and repayment terms can have a big impact on how much interest you'll pay and your monthly payment.</p><h3>1. Interest rates and APR</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Interest rates</a> impact the total cost of your loan and your monthly payment. Generally speaking, you want to choose the loan with the lowest interest rate, because a lower interest rate means lower total borrowing costs and lower monthly payments.</p><p>This is an especially important consideration for a $250,000 personal loan, as a difference of even 1 percentage point can have a costly impact on the interest you pay over the life of the loan.</p><p>For example, a $250,000 loan paid back over 10 years at 18% will cost $290,556 in interest over the life of the loan. Raising the interest rate to 19% will add nearly $20,000 to your total loan cost and increase your monthly payment from $4,506 to $4,667.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:258990":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"258990","content":"<p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR vs. Interest Rate on a Personal Loan: What To Know</a></p><h3>2. Fees</h3><p>The most common fees charged on personal loans are origination fees and late fees. Few, if any, lenders charge prepayment penalties.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\"><strong>Origination fee</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some lenders charge an origination fee to cover the cost of processing your application or to offset their risk in lending to you. The fee is typically a percentage of the loan amount, and may be deducted upfront from the loan amount. For example, if you're borrowing $250,000 and your origination fee is 4%, you'd pay $10,000 upfront out of the loan proceeds and receive $240,000.</li><li><strong>Late fee:</strong> Some lenders assess a late fee to your next monthly payment if you don't make your monthly payment within a certain number of days of the due date (known as a grace period). Late fees typically range from a certain percentage of your unpaid monthly payment or a flat fee, such as $25, whichever is higher.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\"><strong>Prepayment penalty</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A prepayment penalty is a fee a lender charges if you pay your loan back early. These fees are uncommon.</li></ul><h3>3. Repayment terms</h3><p>Your loan's repayment term is the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">length of time you pay back your loan</a>. Most personal loans have repayment terms of two to seven years. However, a $250,000 loan with BHG could have a repayment term of up to 10 years. Some lenders may offer even longer repayment terms for <a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement loans</a>.</p><p>The key thing to keep in mind is that longer repayment terms have higher total interest costs as well as lower monthly payments.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:258978":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"258978","content":"<h3>4.<strong> </strong>Monthly payment</h3><p>As noted, the amount of your monthly payment is directly related to the repayment term you choose. As you compare $250,000 personal loan options, try to find a repayment term that keeps your payments affordable while reining in interest costs.</p><h3>5. Total repayment costs</h3><p>Your loan's total repayment cost includes, at minimum, the loan principal, upfront fees, and total interest payments. (Avoid late fees to limit additional costs.)</p><p>A high loan amount, such as $250,000, along with a relatively long repayment term like 10 years, could result in a total cost that exceeds the amount you borrow.</p><h2>What is the cost to repay a 250K loan?</h2><p>When you apply for a financial product of any kind, it's important to understand how much it will cost. Knowing that cost is even more important with a $250,000 loan.</p><p>Total costs for a $250,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term could look as follows at different rates:</p><ul><li>12%: $180,413</li><li>15%: $234,005</li><li>20%: $329,767</li></ul><p>Disclosure: Based on loans with 10-year repayment terms and no origination fees.</p><p>Here are more examples of what total costs could look like for a no-fee $250,000 personal loan at five different repayment terms (all are at 18% APR).

Brian Seymour II, founder of Prosperitage Wealth, warns to think carefully before proceeding.</p><p>“If it helps grow your net worth (e.g., consolidating high-interest debt), it might make sense,” he says. “But if it's covering overspending or short-term lifestyle costs, it could become a long-term burden.

Make sure the return on that borrowed money justifies the cost and that you've properly evaluated the risks.”</p><h2>How to get a $250,000 personal loan</h2><p>While it doesn't take long to prequalify and apply for a loan, there are key steps you should follow to find the best rates and terms.</p><ul><li><strong>Review your credit score and profile:</strong> Use a free service like <a href=\"/free-credit-score\">Credible's free credit score tool</a> and check your report (different from your score) at <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. If you find errors, dispute them with the appropriate bureau before applying for a loan.</li><li><strong>Calculate your estimated monthly payments:</strong> Calculating your monthly payments before you prequalify and apply will help you understand how much loan you can afford based on your budget. Use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to help.</li><li><strong>Research and compare lenders:</strong> When reviewing personal loan lenders, note any fees charged and what minimum credit score or minimum income may be required.</li><li><strong>Prequalify with multiple lenders:</strong> Getting prequalification quotes from more than one lender lets you compare rates, upfront fees, repayment terms, and monthly payments to find the best fit for your financial situation. Keep in mind that <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalification</a> isn't an offer of credit. The rates and terms of a loan offer may differ.</li><li><strong>Prepare documentation and apply:</strong> Once you choose the best prequalification quote, take a moment to find out which documents your lender requires you to submit. Then, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">fill out a formal application</a>.</li><li><strong>Review terms, sign, and begin repayment:</strong> If the lender approves your application, it will send a loan contract. Look over the details of the contract and double-check the terms of your loan. If you're satisfied with the offer, sign the contract. Your payments should begin the following month.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to a 250K loan</h2><p>The main alternatives to a $250,000 personal loan are HELOCs and home equity loans.</p><h3>HELOC</h3><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">HELOC</a> is a line of credit that lenders offer based on how much equity (home value minus your mortgage balance) you have in your home and several other factors. A HELOC usually has two phases: draw and repayment.</p><p>During your draw period, you can draw money from your HELOC up to your limit. You'll make interest-only monthly payments only on what you withdraw. When your draw period ends, your repayment period begins. During this phase, you'll pay back principal plus interest, which means your monthly payments will likely see a big jump.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:258986":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"258986","content":"<h3>Home equity loan</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">Home equity loans</a> are similar to personal loans in that they're installment loans.

Check to make sure you meet eligibility requirements before applying.</li><li><strong>APR:</strong> The annual percentage rate (APR) accounts for any upfront fees and the loan’s interest rate. Since credit unions don’t typically charge upfront fees, the APR and interest rate are often the same. Use this number to compare how much each loan costs when you prequalify.</li><li><strong>Repayment term:</strong> The repayment term you choose impacts the size of your monthly payment and your overall interest costs. For lower monthly payments, choose a longer term. For lower interest costs, choose a shorter term.</li><li><strong>Loan amount:</strong> Some credit unions offer different loan amounts for different loan purposes — commonly, home improvement loans have higher maximum amounts.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> Most credit unions can fund loans the same or next business day, once you’re approved.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Credit unions tend to charge fewer fees than banks and online lenders, and often don’t charge an origination fee. But it’s worth confirming that.</li><li><strong>Allowed loan purposes:</strong> Most credit unions, including the ones above, allow you to use your loan for a wide range of purposes. Still, make sure the credit union will approve your loan purpose before applying.</li><li><strong>Other benefits:</strong> Some credit unions offer hardship assistance, educational resources, discounts, or other benefits.

Since your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, those on-time payments can help raise your credit score steadily over time. Additionally, it can show lenders that you're a responsible borrower and could make it easier for you to get credit in the future.</p><p>Set up automatic payments to avoid missing due dates. Some banks and online lenders also offer small APR discounts for setting up automatic payments.</p><h3>Credit utilization</h3><p>Your credit utilization ratio shows how much of your available credit you're using on revolving debt, such as credit cards. The ratio factors into your amounts owed, which makes up 30% of your credit score. While debt from personal loans doesn't factor into credit utilization, using a personal loan for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation</a> can have an indirect effect. The utilization ratio on any cards you pay off completely would drop to 0%, likely providing a boost to your credit score.</p><p>Credit utilization is measured both on individual accounts, such as each credit card, and as an aggregate of all your revolving debt. FICO recommends keeping your total credit utilization ratio below 10%.</p><h3>Credit mix</h3><p>Lenders generally like to see that you know how to handle several types of credit and loan accounts. As such, 10% of your credit score is based on your credit mix. If you don't have an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a>, such as a personal loan or auto loan, in your credit history, adding one might provide a slight boost to your credit score. Making timely monthly payments on the loan could help even more.</p><h2>How a personal loan can hurt your credit score</h2><ul><li><strong>Increases your debt:</strong> Taking on debt can bring down your score since, again, it would increase your total amount owed. This can affect your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>, which lenders also use to determine whether to lend to you. Your DTI is the amount you pay monthly toward your debt, divided by your pretax monthly income. In general, it's best to have a DTI below 35%.</li><li><strong>Adds a new credit inquiry:</strong> When you send in an application for a personal loan, it triggers a hard credit inquiry, which is added to your credit profile. While this will typically have only a <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">small impact on your credit</a>, the number of inquiries over the last 12 months is also counted. In general, you want this number to be as small as possible. Inquiries typically stay on your credit report for two years.</li></ul><p>“It's also critical to know you'll be able to make payments before taking out a personal loan. Your score can easily deteriorate if you find you can't make those payments on time or you begin to lag behind,” said Christian Simmons, a certified educator in personal finance. “A credit score can seem like an abstract or unimportant concept to some people, but having a good one can put you ahead in a number of financial situations — while having a poor one can significantly set you back.”</p><h2>What credit score is needed for a personal loan?</h2><p>Lenders generally want to see that you can meet certain requirements, such as a certain <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score</a>, to approve your application.</p><p>Lenders typically want to see a “good” FICO score of 670 or higher, though minimums among lenders vary.</p><p>Here's how FICO breaks down credit score ranges:</p><ul><li><strong>Under 580:</strong> Poor</li><li><strong>580 to 669:</strong> Fair</li><li><strong>670 to 739:</strong> Good</li><li><strong>740 to 799:</strong> Very Good</li><li><strong>800 or higher:</strong> Exceptional</li></ul><h2>How to get a personal loan</h2><p>Here are the steps to take out a personal loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Determine your loan needs:</strong> You'll first need to know exactly <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">how much you need to borrow</a> and how you plan to use it. You should also know the features you require from a lender, such as online payments and discount opportunities.</li><li><strong>Gather documentation:</strong> Typically, you'll need to provide documentation such as pay stubs or bank statements, as well as proof of residence (like a utility bill) and a form of ID. Having those ready will streamline the application process.</li><li><strong>Shop around:</strong> You can start <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">comparing lenders</a> that meet your criteria. Consider factors such as loan amounts, time to fund, and repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Get prequalified:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> checks to see if you're likely to qualify with a given lender, and if so, what your terms might look like — without hurting your credit. You should keep in mind, however, that prequalification does not show the exact rates or terms you'd receive if you formally applied for the loan. So there's some room for error, though it's still a helpful tool.</li><li><strong>Pick a lender:</strong> Consider the potential costs associated with each lender, such as the <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which includes the interest rate and fees. But you should also check if the lender provides any of those extra features you pinpointed in your wish list. A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">loan calculator</a> can come in handy here, since it can compare the potential costs associated with each lender.</li><li><strong>Send in your application:</strong> Follow the instructions supplied by the lender, including supplying any additional materials it may request. At this point, the lender will conduct a hard credit inquiry, which can lower your score slightly for about a year. The amount of time it will take to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete the application</a> and get approved depends on the lender. Some lenders can <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">fund your loan</a> as soon as the same or next business day.</li><li><strong>Sign for the loan:</strong> Once approved, you can sign your loan documents, get your funds, and start making payments.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How To Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>How to improve your credit score after getting a personal loan</h2><p>Once you've received your loan, your work as a responsible credit user isn't done. Here are a few strategies that could help boost your credit score:</p><ul><li><strong>Repay your loan on time:</strong> Though a single on-time payment likely won't improve your credit score, making consistent on-time payments could make a big difference. Remember, payment history is the single largest factor in your FICO score, accounting for 35%.</li><li><strong>Consolidate debt, but don't eliminate cards: </strong>If you're using a debt consolidation loan to pay off credit cards, keep the cards open. The length of your credit history, which includes how long individual accounts have been open, accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Even though you may have resolved never to run up balances on those cards again, closing them would reduce the average age of your credit accounts.</li><li><strong>Wait before applying for new credit:</strong> Credit applications typically involve a hard credit inquiry that could lower your credit score by up to five points for as long as one year — and stay on your credit report for two years. So if the loan you just received triggered a hard credit check, your credit score may already be feeling the effects. Even a small, temporary dip in your credit score can chip away at any improvements you make.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye on your credit: </strong>Keeping tabs on your credit score can help you catch errors or unauthorized accounts that pop up. You can check your credit report for free with <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> or find out if your bank provides free credit monitoring.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227070":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227070","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\"><i>What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\"><i>What Are Personal Loans Used For?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\"><i>Secured vs. Unsecured Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan\"><i>Best Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Fair Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-good-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Good Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Excellent Credit</i></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"}},"120":{"ROOT_QUERY":{"__typename":"Query","getTrustpilotData":{"__typename":"Trustpilot","numberOfReviews":8951,"stars":5}}}};

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit.

For example, Space Coast Credit Union offers competitive rates on CDs and CD-secured loans for up to 100% of the value of your CD. If you&#x27;re eligible to join such a credit union, you could get the loan you need for a very low net rate. Plus, CDs are federally insured by the NCUA for up to $250,000.”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">— Meredith Mangan, Senior Loans Editor, Credible</em></p></section></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You&#x27;ll find that some credit unions offer online applications like banks and online lenders do, too.

However, one drawback is that most lines of credit have variable rates — which could be risky if you need to budget carefully for repayment and don&#x27;t want to risk rising costs.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">In many cases, you&#x27;ll need a minimum portfolio value to qualify, which could be more than the $250,000 you need to borrow.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-to-compare--personal-loans">How to compare $250,000 personal loans</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Comparing your options for a $250,000 loan is an important step in the borrowing process because loans of this amount can have high borrowing costs. Small differences in interest rates and repayment terms can have a big impact on how much interest you&#x27;ll pay and your monthly payment.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">1.

Generally speaking, you want to choose the loan with the lowest interest rate, because a lower interest rate means lower total borrowing costs and lower monthly payments.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">This is an especially important consideration for a $250,000 personal loan, as a difference of even 1 percentage point can have a costly impact on the interest you pay over the life of the loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For example, a $250,000 loan paid back over 10 years at 18% will cost $290,556 in interest over the life of the loan. Raising the interest rate to 19% will add nearly $20,000 to your total loan cost and increase your monthly payment from $4,506 to $4,667.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_pin__z_PTM"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAgCAYAAAAbifjMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAD9SURBVHgB7ZQxTsMwFIb/P6YREksFF4jKRDZuULaOXTOVlgMgTgBchFbKCZhgI9ygA3SEHADRzFC/hz2UoaVScDvmW2w/+f/kwe8BW8L5qHOt4A3+T0mxp1Fg2JPYyPQjt6kQiFE73xPBMCIuFxaJCJM6wbilhZLPh+PynsvirHcyATmoI0gfZr+5CFvSCBrBTgT8uDjuUzGw3+yKsl0nFLfE9YJOj+7ervg56rw7T4IABK4RQ8NL/EC5RQiqUyO24Gr9pZeeu/kwXg+wSB9fz9ZesFoQagVFuYj3q6+DNvzqz/D1PyA2kOd51xjzRHKSZdlw073mKzeCnQh+AIFqUAFq25YWAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="pin Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_pinImg__6k6q1"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_pinTitle__dnoCL styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Important</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">Your interest rate is the rate your lender charges to borrow money.

During this phase, you&#x27;ll pay back principal plus interest, which means your monthly payments will likely see a big jump.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_tip__LuW2g"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="tip Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_tipImg__EX55M"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_tipTitle__RIk_D styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Good to know</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">HELOC rates are typically variable, which means they rise and fall each month based on market conditions.

One guideline you can follow is the 28% rule, which suggests you spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. Let’s use the earlier example that assumes a 30-year loan term and 6% APR, which results in a monthly payment of $1,498.88. Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000.
