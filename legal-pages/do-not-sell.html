Be prepared to provide documents like tax returns, W-2s, and bank statements.</li><li><strong>Wait for full approval: </strong>Your loan will move into underwriting, which means your application is evaluated, your income is verified, and all the numbers are crunched. The lender will also request a home appraisal to ensure it’s worth the money you’re looking to borrow for it.</li><li><strong>Prep for closing: </strong>Once you get your closing date, you’ll need to arrange for homeowners insurance because your lender will likely require it.

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline. How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility.

The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee. Chime only charges $2 for instant delivery, and transfers within 24 hours are free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advances can be helpful if you're in a tight financial spot, they aren't meant to be something you continually rely on to cover your expenses, said Dr. Severine Bryan, founder of financial education and coaching company Sev Talks Money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319326","content":"<p>If you need to borrow money but don't want to use cash advance apps, you have several other options.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live. Because the fees are so high, payday loan borrowers often find themselves taking a new advance to pay back their old advance, which creates a cycle of debt, says Nia Adams, executive director at financial wellness consultancy Perspectives.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319330","content":"<h3>Payday alternative loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loans</a> (or PALs) are small, low-cost loans offered by some federal credit unions.

You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky.

However, it depends on which <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/types-of-student-loans\">type of student loan</a> you have.</p><p>“The federal government does not sell loans, but they may need to move them from one loan servicer to another,” says Pam Sittig, director of financial aid at Grinnell College.</p><p>“Private lenders may choose to sell educational loans. The reasons for selling private educational loans are likely similar to when mortgage loans are sold,” she adds.</p><p>Federal loan servicers have contracts with the U.S. Department of Education. Sometimes, those contracts don't get renewed. When that happens, that happens, your federal loans are transferred to a new loan servicer. In this case, the Department of Education continues to be your lender but outsources the loan servicing to a new company.</p><p>“Only private loan lenders sell loans,” says student loan lawyer Joshua Cohen. “Often, it's simply to monetize losses — that is, they sell <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/defaulting-on-student-loans\">defaulted loans</a> to debt buyers as a way to recoup some lost value.”</p><p>So, when it comes to student loan transfers, one of the main distinctions is who owns and services the loans.</p><h2>Current private student loan refinance rates</h2>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:5890":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"5890","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rate-table","variation":"shortened"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:215210":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"215210","content":"<h2>What happens when your student loan is transferred?</h2><p>Your current loan servicer will notify you before transferring your loans.

Make sure the note you receive from your current lender or loan servicer is on official letterhead or from an actual email address from the company. Then, contact your new loan servicer to confirm your loans are being transferred. Doing your due diligence can help you avoid potential student loan scams.</li><li><strong>Create a new account: </strong>When your student loan is sold to another lender or is transferred, you must create an account with the new loan servicer. Go to the loan servicer's website and follow the instructions to create an online login. Typically, you'll create a username and password that gives you access to your account and student loan information. “When a new loan servicer appears, note the address for sending payment and be sure to create an online account to stay on top of any communications and online bills,” says Cohen.</li><li><strong>Update your payment method: </strong>After creating an account with your new loan servicer, update your payment method so you can make payments. Most loan servicers allow you to pay using your debit card or your checking or savings accounts.</li><li><strong>Review account information: </strong>Once the transfer is complete, review your account information for accuracy. Make sure your balance, interest rates, and repayment plan are the same. The transfer shouldn't interrupt your repayment status. So, if you were in <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> before the transfer, you should still be in deferment. If you were enrolled in an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">income-driven repayment plan</a>, you should still be on an IDR plan. Of course, it's a good idea to double-check.</li><li><strong>Re-enroll in autopay: </strong>If your student loan is sold to another lender or transferred, you likely need to re-enroll in autopay. You gave the previous company consent to withdraw funds from your account. Since it's a new loan servicer, you must consent again. Make sure to re-enroll in autopay and continue to make payments manually until it's in effect. When you sign up for autopay, you may qualify for an interest rate deduction of 0.25 percentage points.</li></ol><h2>Does a loan servicer transfer affect repayment plans?</h2><p>If your student loan is sold to another lender or transferred to another loan servicer, it shouldn't affect your repayment plan. Verify that you're on the same repayment plan as before. If not, contact your new lender or loan servicer right away.</p><p>This is especially important for borrowers on income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. You might be working toward <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</a> or IDR forgiveness — in both cases, your monthly payment count matters and gets you closer to forgiveness.</p><p>If you're dealing with a new loan servicer, make sure you're still on an IDR plan. Contact your new loan servicer about when you'll need to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/recertify-income-student-loans\">recertify your income</a> and family size for the plan. If you'd like to switch repayment plans, your loan servicer can assist you in the process.</p><h2>Can you stop your student loan from being sold?</h2><p>Getting a notice that your student loan has been sold to another lender or transferred to a new loan servicer can be an unwanted change. Unfortunately, you can't do anything about it.</p><p>When you sign your student loan's promissory note, you agree to the loan terms and conditions. The Master Promissory Note, which federal loan borrowers sign, states that their loans may be transferred to another loan servicer.</p><p>If you want more agency to choose your lender and loan servicer, you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">refinance your student loans</a>. This allows you to compare different refinancing lenders and choose the one you want to work with.</p><p>Private student loan refinancing companies may be able to offer you a lower interest rate than you currently have, depending on your credit score and history. You can also change your loan terms.</p><p>While this can put you back in control, refinancing federal loans also makes you ineligible for important federal loan protections and benefits, since refinancing <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans\">pays off your existing student loans</a> with a private loan. Therefore, you won't qualify for student loan forgiveness, income-driven repayment, or other perks.</p><p>If you don't plan to take advantage of federal benefits and you have a solid credit score and income, refinancing may help you reduce <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">interest charges</a> and allow you to work with the lender of your choice.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:5894":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"5894","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:281874":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"281874","content":"<p>LightStream and SoFi are two of the best lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-good-credit\">good credit personal loans</a>.

With a lower starting rate of 6.49%, LightStream may be a better deal for borrowers with excellent credit. SoFi rates start at 8.99%, but you’d need to enroll in autopay and set up direct deposit with a SoFi bank account to qualify for the lowest APR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Minimum credit score</h3><p>LightStream only accepts applicants with good or excellent credit. SoFi doesn’t publish a minimum credit score, but poor and fair credit borrowers may have <a href=\"/personal-loan/denied-personal-loan\">difficulty getting approved</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan purpose</h3><p>Both SoFi and LightStream allow borrowers to use the loan funds for most personal and household expenses. <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-cant-you-use-a-personal-loan-for\">Restricted loan uses</a> include college educational expenses, business expenses, and investments. SoFi additionally prohibits you from using the funds for real estate purposes, while LightStream allows you to use a personal loan to purchase a timeshare.&nbsp;</p><p>However, LightStream stands out if you need to finance home improvements, given the longer repayment term options, and SoFi might work better for&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">debt consolidation</a> because the bank provides a discount if you have the funds sent directly to your creditors. Note that SoFi loans through Credible are only available for consolidating debt and/or refinancing credit cards.&nbsp;</p><h3>Repayment terms</h3><p>SoFi and LightStream both offer a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">range of repayment terms</a>, with options from two to seven years for most loan types, but LightStream offers long repayment terms up to 20 years for home improvement loans. If you’re planning to use the loan for a home renovation project, LightStream offers more flexibility than SoFi and lower rates.</p><h3>Loan amount</h3><p>LightStream and SoFi offer an identical <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">range of loan amounts</a> — from $5,000 to $100,000. Depending on your financial profile, however, you may qualify for a larger amount with one lender than the other. If you’re looking for a loan for less than $5,000, consider lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-small-loan\">small personal loans</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Time to fund</h3><p>LightStream and SoFi offer funding as soon as the same business day, but loans from either lender took several days to fund based on 12 months of Credible personal loan marketplace data. Other lenders like Discover, Upgrade, and Upstart funded loans in two days, on average.&nbsp;</p><p>SoFi disburses funds via ACH transfer the same day you’re approved, provided you sign your loan documents before 6 p.m. ET on a business day. LightStream offers same-day wire transfers, but you’ll need to log in by 2:30 p.m. ET on a business day to get your cash that day.

Generally speaking, here’s what you can expect.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Check your credit:</strong>&nbsp;Before applying with any lender, check your credit score to ensure you meet the lender’s minimum credit score requirement. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">check your credit score for free</a> using Credible's credit-monitoring tool. SoFi doesn’t disclose a minimum credit score requirement, but LightStream requires a minimum 700 FICO credit score if applying through Credible.</li><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong>&nbsp;Use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-credible-personal-loan\">personal loan marketplace</a> to qualify with LightStream, SoFi, and other lenders to get an estimate of the APR and loan terms you might be approved for. SoFi allows you to prequalify directly on its website with no credit impact. LightStream does not. When comparing your options, pay attention to the monthly payment and total interest in addition to the APR.</li><li><strong>Formally apply:</strong>&nbsp;Once you’ve compared loan quotes and made a choice, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply on the lender’s website</a> or follow the next steps to apply outlined after the prequalification process. You’ll need to provide info about your employment, income, and assets. Since formally applying typically requires a&nbsp;hard credit inquiry, you should limit the number of applications to minimize the damage to your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sign your loan documents:</strong>&nbsp;If approved, the lender will send a formal loan offer. Read the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, and ensure the final rate and monthly payment work for you. Then, e-sign the documents.</li><li><strong>Get the money:</strong>&nbsp;If you want a same-day wire transfer from LightStream, you’ll need to log in to your account and request the transfer in time. SoFi will transfer funds via ACH automatically, so you can sit back and wait for the money to arrive in your account. In either case, the exact timeline for receiving the funds will depend on your application, when you sign, and where you bank.&nbsp;</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:281902":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"281902","content":"<h2>Which lender is best for you?</h2><h3>Best for home improvement loans: LightStream</h3><p>LightStream offers large loan amounts up to $100,000, APRs as low as 6.99%, and repayment terms up to 20 years for its home improvement loans.

In most cases, home equity builds over time as you pay down the&nbsp;home loan&nbsp;and wait for your home to gain value.</p><h3>Calculating the equity in your home</h3><p>You can calculate your home equity by subtracting your mortgage balance from the home’s market value.</p><p>Let’s say your home is worth $300,000 and you still owe $210,000 on the mortgage. Your home equity would be $90,000:</p><blockquote><p><strong>$300,000 – $210,000 = $90,000</strong></p></blockquote><p>Check your most recent billing statement to find your mortgage balance, or call the loan servicer to ask. To estimate your market value, you can look at recent, comparable home sales in your area or check third-party websites such as Zillow and Redfin.</p><h2>How home equity works</h2><p>When you take out a mortgage, lenders usually require a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/down-payment\">down payment</a>. That money becomes your original equity stake, and you build more equity as you pay down the loan.</p><p>Homeowners with shorter loan terms build equity faster because they make larger payments over a shorter time frame.</p><p>Home equity is influenced by two factors — your mortgage balance and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-increase-home-value\">home’s value</a>&nbsp;— and changes over time. To get an idea of how it works, take a look at one example:</p><p>Say you take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an APR of 3% for a home worth $300,000. After making your down payment of 20%, your equity starts at&nbsp;<strong>$60,000</strong>,&nbsp;and your mortgage balance starts at $240,000.</p><p>After making on-time payments for five years, the mortgage balance decreases to $213,430. And because real estate prices have increased in your area, your home is now valued at $350,000.</p><p>You crunch the numbers to get your current home equity: $350,000 – $213,430 =&nbsp;<strong>$136,570</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Good to know:</strong>&nbsp;This process also works in reverse. In the above example, say that in another five years, home values have dipped — and your home is now worth $290,000.</p></blockquote><p>Your mortgage balance has decreased to $182,566, but because of the decrease in value, your home equity drops a bit as well: $290,000 – $182,566 =&nbsp;<strong>$107,434</strong>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:21418":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"21418","content":"<h2>How to build home equity</h2><p>Home equity usually grows over time — which benefits you — and there are ways to move it along:</p><h3>Make your mortgage payments</h3><p>Every time you make a monthly mortgage payment, you gain a little more equity in the home. That’s because a portion of your monthly mortgage payment goes toward the principal balance on your home loan.</p><p>In the beginning, a smaller amount goes toward the principal and more goes toward interest.</p><p>This process, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-amortization\">amortization</a>, means you usually build more equity toward the end of the loan term. Once the principal is paid off, you own the entire home.</p><p>Use our <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">mortgage calculator to see your amortization plan</a>.</p><h3>Pay your mortgage down faster</h3><p>Many lenders allow homeowners to make additional payments toward their principal. This can help you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/pay-off-early\">pay off your mortgage sooner</a>, build equity faster, and save on interest.</p><p>Talk with your lender about this strategy and ask if the mortgage comes with prepayment penalties. Once you start making extra payments, tell your lender that they should be applied to the principal only.</p><p>You don’t have to make big payments, either. Some homeowners choose to:</p><ul><li>Make one extra mortgage payment every year</li><li>Add extra money to each monthly payment</li><li>Use any one-time windfalls, such as a work bonus or inheritance, to pay down the principal</li></ul><h3>Wait for your property value to rise</h3><p>Equity is also based on the market value of the home. Fortunately, home values tend to rise over time — even if you do nothing to the property.</p><p>Over the past 25 years, homes appreciated by 3.9% per year on average, according to mortgage data firm Black Knight.</p><p>Say you pay $300,000 for your home with $60,000 down. That gives you a $240,000 principal balance and $60,000 in equity right off the bat. After making on-time payments for one year, say your principal balance is now $234,000 — $6,000 less than when you started. Assuming the value of your home remains the same, you would have $66,000 in equity.</p><p>Using Black Knight’s average, if the home value increases 3.9%, or $11,700, over the year, your equity would increase by the same amount. In this example, your home would now be worth $311,700, and you would have $77,135 in equity:</p><blockquote><p><strong>$311,700 (value) – $234,000 (principal balance) = $77,700 in equity</strong></p></blockquote><h3>Make a big down payment</h3><p>If you’ve not yet purchased a home, you can start with more equity by making a larger down payment. Each extra dollar you pay upfront increases your equity — and reduces the amount you need to finance.</p><h3>Refinance to a shorter loan term</h3><p>When you refinance from a 30-year loan to a 15- or 20-year loan, more of your payment goes toward the loan principal, so you build equity faster. In the case of a 30-year, $240,000 loan with a 3% fixed rate, you would build $5,435 in equity in the first year. That amount increases to $9,467 after the first year with a 20-year loan and $13,954 with a 15-year loan.</p><h3>Get rid of mortgage insurance</h3><p>This tip is a catch-22 in that you have to build equity to get rid of your mortgage insurance. Contact your lender once you reach 20% equity to request that the insurance be terminated — the lender might not do it automatically until you reach 22% equity.</p><p>Once you’re rid of the PMI premium, keep paying the same amount you paid before the PMI was discontinued. The extra payment will pay down the principal faster, increasing your equity as it does.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An even better option:</strong>&nbsp;Designate the additional amount as an extra principal payment each month. That way, you build equity faster while reducing the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.</p></blockquote><h3>Renovate your home</h3><p>Renovation projects — like adding a bedroom, remodeling the kitchen, and finishing the basement — could help boost your home’s market value. In turn, your home equity grows — as long as you don’t finance the work by borrowing against your house.</p><p>While you might not recoup all of the costs involved in a renovation project, homeowners typically get back most of the money they spend on average.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Talk with a real estate agent or a contractor to figure out how to maximize your home’s potential.</p></blockquote><h2>Why building equity in your home is important</h2><p>The more equity you build, the more protection you have against fluctuating property values, leaving you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/underwater-mortgage\">underwater on your mortgage</a>&nbsp;— that is, owing more on your mortgage than the home is worth.</p><p>While not a financial emergency in and of itself, being underwater can render you unable to sell your home. It also leaves you vulnerable to losing your home if you experience a financial setback like losing your job or incurring major medical expenses.</p><p>Even if you’re not underwater, low equity has a serious drawback: It makes the equity you do have inaccessible or expensive to access. Most lenders want you to have at least 20% equity to qualify for a home equity loan or cash-out refinance. Having less than 20% equity in your home may result in you paying higher interest rates or mortgage insurance to access the equity.</p><h2>How to use the equity in your home</h2><p>Your home equity makes up a part of your total net worth. You can tap into it by either selling the property or borrowing money and using the home as collateral. Here are some of your options:</p><h3>Buy a new home</h3><p>If you’re ready to sell your home, you can use the proceeds as a down payment when you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-buy-a-house\">buy a new place</a>. Making a large down payment can help shrink the size of your new monthly mortgage payments since you’re borrowing less.</p><p>And if you put down at least 20% of the home’s value, you could also avoid private mortgage insurance.</p><h3>Pay for home improvements</h3><p>Using your equity to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance-for-home-improvement\">improve your home</a>&nbsp;can be a smart way to invest in your property since it can help boost the market value.</p><p>You don’t have to go for big projects, either. Common home improvement projects that can help preserve or increase your home’s resale price include:</p><ul><li>Making repairs</li><li>Painting</li><li>Deep cleaning</li><li>Preventive maintenance</li><li>Landscaping</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>If you’d rather not use your equity to pay for renovations, you may want to consider a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement loan</a>&nbsp;instead.</p></blockquote><h3>Pay off high-interest debt</h3><p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit tend to have lower interest rates than personal loans, credit cards, and other types of debt products.</p><p>Using this strategy, you tap your home equity at a low interest rate, pay off your higher-interest debts, and pay down the new loan over time — saving money in the process.</p><h3>Use it for retirement</h3><p>Home equity helps to secure your retirement even if you’re unable to pay off your mortgage before you retire. You can supplement your Social Security and retirement savings income with the equity in your home, using it to pay for medical expenses, home improvements, or whatever you wish.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;If you haven’t paid off your mortgage by the time you retire, and you’ve made extra payments over the years, or plan to make a lump sum payment to further increase your equity, consider asking your lender to recast your mortgage. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage-recast\">mortgage recast</a>&nbsp;can reduce your monthly payment without changing your interest rate, and it’s significantly cheaper than a refinance.</p></blockquote><h2>How to borrow against home equity</h2><p>If you’re looking to take advantage of your home equity without selling your home, you have a few options.</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:</strong>&nbsp;Paying for one-time expenses</p></blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a>&nbsp;is a second mortgage that uses the property as collateral. You receive the money in one lump sum upfront, then pay it back in installments over a specified number of years.</p><p>The maximum amount you can borrow with a home equity loan varies by lender, but it’s typically around 85% of the equity in your home. So, if you have $110,000 in equity, then you might be able to borrow up to $93,500.</p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who aren’t sure how much money they’ll need</p></blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/heloc\">home equity line of credit</a>&nbsp;is another type of second mortgage. Instead of getting money upfront, though, you get access to a line of credit.</p><p>You can borrow from the line of credit anytime during a “draw period,” which usually lasts around 10 years. If you pay off any of the balance during that time, the line of credit replenishes—much like a credit card.</p><p>The amount you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">borrow on a HELOC</a>&nbsp;varies, but it’s usually around 75% to 85% of the value of your home, minus your mortgage balance.</p><p>So, if your home is worth $290,000 and you owe $185,000 on the mortgage, then the most you can borrow is $61,500.</p><h3>Cash-out refinance</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who want new loan terms</p></blockquote><p>With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a>, you take out a new mortgage that’s bigger than your current balance, use the proceeds to pay off the original loan, and pocket the difference.</p><p>Because you’re getting a new loan, your terms can be more suitable to your current situation.</p><p>For instance, you might change the loan term, get a lower interest rate, or shift from an adjustable-rate mortgage to one with a fixed rate.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Good to know:&nbsp;</strong>Lenders usually limit the amount you can borrow on a cash-out refinance to 80% of your home’s total value, less whatever you still owe on your mortgage.</p></blockquote><p>Say your home is worth $290,000 and you owe $185,000. The most you can borrow with a cash-out refinance loan in this case is $232,000 — $185,000 to pay off your existing loan, plus $47,000 in cash.</p><h3>Reverse mortgage</h3><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who are at least 62 years old and have enough equity</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-does-a-reverse-mortgage-work\">reverse mortgage</a>&nbsp;is a special type of home loan that’s available to homeowners who are at least 62 years old. The amount you can borrow is based on how much equity you have in your home.</p><p>Once you receive the money, you’ll pay off any existing mortgage balance and use the remaining funds as you see fit. Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, the loan is repaid when you die, sell the home, or move out.</p><p>Aside from the age requirement, you’ll need to meet a few other requirements to be eligible. The home must be your principal residence, and you must stay on top of your property taxes, homeowners insurance, and routine maintenance.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319090":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319090","content":"<p>INvestEd has been offering student loans, parent loans, and refinance loans at affordable rates for over 45 years.

The amount that accrues depends on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-high-interest-rate\">interest rate</a>, which can vary by loan type (federal or private) or degree type (undergraduate or graduate).&nbsp;</p><p>“Interest rates on federal student loans are the same for all borrowers, while interest rates on private student loans may vary depending on the credit score of the borrower and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner</a>, if any,” says Mark Kantrowitz, an education financing expert and author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>In most cases, student loan interest accrues daily. Lenders use a formula that multiplies your principal balance and interest rate, then divides by 365.25 (the number of days in a year, accounting for leap years). Unlike some other types of loans, student loans don’t compound interest in the traditional sense.&nbsp;</p><h2>Student loan interest calculation formula</h2><p>The daily student loan interest formula is:</p><p><strong>(Current principal balance × interest rate) ÷ 365.25 = Daily interest accrual</strong></p><p>Here’s an example of how to calculate interest on student loans for a principal balance of $50,000 on a loan with a 7% interest rate:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Convert the interest rate to a decimal:</strong>&nbsp;You can convert the interest rate percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100. In this case, it would be 7/100, which equals 0.07. Once you have that, you can do the full student loan interest calculation.</li><li><strong>Calculate daily interest:</strong> (50,000 × 0.07) ÷ 365.25 = $9.58 daily interest&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Multiply days between payments for monthly interest:</strong>&nbsp;Usually, you have about 30 days between payments. With this example, you’d pay $287.40 (9.58 x 30 = 287.4) per month in interest.</li></ol><h2>How interest accrues on federal vs. private student loans</h2><p>Interest accrues similarly for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/hidden-costs-federal-direct-unsubsidized-student-loans\">federal student loans</a> and private student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>“Interestingly, both federal student loans and most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> accrue interest on a simple interest basis,” says Glenn Sanger-Hodgson, certified student loan professional (CSLP) and founder of Shonan Gold Financial LLC.&nbsp;</p><p>“This means that interest accrues in a separate ‘bucket,’ so to speak, from the principal, and only ever gets added to the principal through a process called capitalization,” he explains. “When borrowers make payments, they are usually applied to any outstanding interest first, and once that’s been paid down, any remaining amount is applied to the principal.”</p><p>However, it’s important to note that some private student loan lenders may use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">compound interest formula</a>. With compound interest, interest is charged on the principal and the unpaid interest, causing it to add up fast. Contact your lender to find out how interest accrues and any capitalization rules.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is student loan interest capitalization?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">Student loan interest capitalization</a> is when unpaid interest is added to your principal balance. That increases your outstanding balance, and you then pay interest on that higher amount. While capitalization can still occur in certain cases, policy changes in recent years have limited how often it happens with federal student loans.</p><p>“On federal student loans, there was a push a few years ago to reduce the number of triggers for interest capitalization,” says Sanger-Hodgson. “Now interest only capitalizes after the end of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> on an unsubsidized loan, or if you are on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan</a> and either no longer have a partial financial hardship or you switch to another plan.”</p><p>That is the case for Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program loans, both managed by the Department of Education. If you have FFEL program loans that aren’t managed by the Department of Education, unpaid interest may capitalize after a grace period or deferment on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">unsubsidized loan</a>, after a forbearance, or if you leave or no longer qualify for the IBR Plan.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324922":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324922","content":"<h2>Understanding compound interest on student loans</h2><p>While most student loans use simple interest, some <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loan rates</a> may involve compound interest, which works differently.</p><p>Instead of just calculating interest on your original balance, it's calculated on the total balance, including any unpaid interest from the previous day. For example, if your loan balance is $10,000 with a daily interest rate of 0.013%, you'll start by accruing $1.30 in interest. The next day, interest is calculated on $10,001.30, so you're paying interest on interest, which increases your costs over time.</p><p>Since compound interest builds off of itself, it's generally more expensive than a simple interest loan.

Here are some ways to reduce student loan interest costs.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pay interest while in school</h3><p>For federal student loans and many private loans, you don’t need to make student loan payments while in school because payments are automatically deferred during this time. However, paying the interest that accrues in school can help you lower costs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Borrowers who are not pursuing a federal public student loan forgiveness program can make interest-only payments while in school to decrease interest accumulation,” says Kelly Reddy-Heffner, a certified financial planner (CFP) at Steel City Wealth Collaborative.</p><h3>Set up autopay&nbsp;</h3><p>You could reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percentage points by signing up for autopay. With autopay, your monthly payments are automatically deducted from your bank account. All federal student loans offer this benefit, and many private lenders offer it as well.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pay more than the minimum&nbsp;</h3><p>Once you figure out how to calculate interest on student loans, you might realize just how fast things can add up. To make a dent, strive to pay more than the minimum each month. If you get a tax refund, raise, birthday money, or other windfall, consider putting more toward your debt.&nbsp;</p><h3>Review your repayment options&nbsp;</h3><p>The student loan landscape is poised for major changes. Borrowers may want to review their repayment options, as there will be an interest benefit on a new plan.&nbsp;</p><p>“Another way to reduce how much interest accrues is by enrolling in a repayment plan that features an unpaid interest subsidy,” says Sanger-Hodgson. “Currently, no active plans offer this, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/repayment-assistance-plan\">Repayment Assistance Plan</a>, which should be available to borrowers by July 1, 2026, will include this feature.

You will have to make them up at a later date according to the terms of the deferment.</li></ul><h2>Where to get a personal loan deferment</h2><p>Unfortunately, personal loan deferment is not always available. Lenders vary in the hardship options they offer and the conditions under which they’ll approve a request. Many lenders state online that you should contact them if you’re having trouble making your payments, and they’ll work with you.</p><p>If you already have a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> and need help, the best thing you can do is contact your lender and share what’s going on. Deferment can be in the best interest of lenders if it seems likely the borrower will get back on track with their payments soon. On the other hand, if you’re planning to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">get a personal loan</a> soon and want to find a lender with helpful hardship programs, research the offerings when shopping around. You may have to call to get specifics.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:226626":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"226626","content":"<h2>How to defer a personal loan payment</h2><p>If you’re interested in deferring a personal loan payment, contact your lender as soon as possible. To avoid negative consequences like late fees and credit score damage, you’ll need to get in touch before you’re late on a payment. When you call, be open and honest about your situation. Explain why you can’t make the payments as agreed, and be prepared with a realistic date that you’ll be able to begin making them again.</p><p>If your lender is willing to defer your loan payments, find out how many payments it will defer and when you’ll be required to repay them. If you and your lender agree on the terms, you’ll be able to skip the agreed-upon payments. However, once the deferments end, you’ll need to make all of your remaining payments on time to avoid a default going forward.</p><h2>Personal loan deferment alternatives</h2><p>If you can’t make your loan payments, deferment isn’t your only option. Here are a few alternatives to consider.</p><h3>Ask your lender about other hardship programs</h3><p>When your lender doesn’t offer loan deferments or isn’t willing to offer you one, inquire about other hardship programs. For example, Upgrade, a Credible partner, has a short-term hardship program that allows borrowers to make reduced payments for a set amount of time. While you can’t completely pause payments, you might be able to reduce them to an amount you can afford.</p><h3>Refinance the loan</h3><p>Refinancing a personal loan involves getting a new loan to pay off your existing one. To go this route, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">collect quotes </a>and see if any other lenders will offer you a more affordable monthly payment. Even if you can’t get a lower interest rate, you may be able to lower your monthly payment amount by extending your loan term.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:226630":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"226630","content":"<h3>Local programs</h3><p>Look into local programs that may be able to provide you with financial support.

For example, check if you can defer payments on other loans like a mortgage, car loan, student loan, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">“buy now, pay later” services</a>, or credit card. You could also contact your utility and insurance providers and ask about deferments or alternative payment plans.</p><h3>Ask a friend or family member for help</h3><p>If you can’t make your upcoming loan payments, perhaps a friend or family member can help you cover them until you’re back on your feet.

A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">mortgage affordability calculator</a> can help you set a budget.</li><li><strong>Do a credit check: </strong>Your credit history and credit score will play a major part in your loan application, so request a copy of your credit report and review it ahead of time. If you have late payments, collection efforts, or other negative events on your report, address those before you apply, as they could hurt your chances. Plus, if there are any fraudulent accounts or errors in your report, you can dispute them with the reporting credit bureau.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved:</strong> It helps to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">get pre-approved for a mortgage</a> before searching for a home. When you apply for pre-approval, the lender reviews your credit history and borrower profile and gives you a letter describing the loan terms and amounts you’re likely to be approved for later. A pre-approval letter can give you a good price range to shop in and give sellers more confidence when you make offers.</li><li><strong>Compare rates and mortgage offers:</strong> Next, you’ll want to compare options.

You will also need to agree to a credit check.</li><li><strong>Await approval: </strong>Your loan will then go into <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">underwriting</a>, which is when your lender verifies your income, savings, and other assets and makes sure you can repay the loan. The lender will also order an appraisal to gauge the home’s value (and make sure it’s worth the money you’re requesting to borrow for it).</li><li><strong>Get ready for closing: </strong>Once your loan is nearing full approval, you’ll get a closing date, which is when you’ll sign the final paperwork and receive your keys.

Set aside time for each of you to discuss your financial situation, including your outstanding debt and monthly payments.</p><p>“It really starts with transparency and honesty,” says Robert Farrington, student debt expert and founder of The College Investor. “Once you know the debt and full view of your finances, you can make a plan that you both understand.”</p><p>This is especially important if one person has a lot more debt than the other, says couples therapist Jessica Schroeder. Without this open communication, the couple may fall into a pattern of insecurity and conflict.</p><p>“Having open, structured, proactive conversations about debt, goals, and responsibilities,” Schroeder says, “can foster teamwork and emotional connection.”</p><h2>Understand how much each person owes</h2><p>Before you can come up with a plan for tackling student loans, you need to know the details of what each person owes, including:</p><ul><li>Total balances</li><li>Interest rates</li><li>Type of loans, whether federal or private</li><li>Monthly payments and due dates</li><li>Repayment plans</li><li>Loan servicers</li></ul><p>For federal student loans, you can find this information by signing in to your Federal Student Aid account. For <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>, you can contact your lenders or review your student loan statements. If you're not sure who you owe, look over your accounts on your credit report, which you can access at <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.</p><p>“It's key to be organized together,” says Farrington. “Whether using an app, spreadsheet, binder, or other tool, both of you should be aware of what you owe, what you earn, and what you have.”</p><p>By understanding where each of you stands, you can move forward together as a team.</p><h2>Decide whether to tackle debt together or separately</h2><p>There's no one-size-fits-all solution for paying off student loans as a couple. Some merge their finances completely, while others hold multiple bank accounts or keep everything separate. The key is figuring out what works for you.</p><p>“Deciding how to manage these things is highly individualized for each couple,” says Kaitlyn Steel, a licensed marriage and family therapist at Keystone Therapy Group. She's worked with some couples who tackle repayment together and others who don't.</p><p>“A benefit of merging finances and tackling debt together can be that it is a joint experience of overcoming difficulty,” says Steel. “That's always a good thing in a long-term, committed relationship.”</p><p>On the flip side, Steel notes that there can be benefits to managing your student loan debt solo.</p><p>“It's highly empowering for someone to pay off their own debt without help,” she says. “That can increase someone's confidence and feelings of contributing well to the family finances.”</p><p>At the end of the day, Steel encourages each person in a relationship to identify and talk about their feelings around money so they can move forward with mutual respect.</p><h3>Are you legally responsible for your spouse's student loan debt?</h3><p>When you get married, you don't become legally responsible for any student loans that your spouse took out before the marriage. However, you will be responsible if you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosign a student loan</a>. Plus, you could become liable for student loans your spouse takes out when you're married if you live in a community property state. There are nine community property states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p><h2>Come up with a plan for repayment</h2><p>There are various approaches to paying off student loans, so come up with a plan that works for both of you. That may mean paying the minimum each month while you balance other financial goals, like saving for retirement or a down payment for a home. Or, you might pay extra on your loans to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loan-early\">get out of debt faster</a>.</p><p>“I've observed that couples who align on their financial goals often achieve great success in managing student loans,” says Caedmon Meisenheimer, a certified financial planner (CFP) and owner of 310 Wealth Planning. “When [they] share a clear vision and work together, they can create a solid plan to tackle their financial challenges.”</p><p>If you have federal loans, review your various repayment plan options, such as standard repayment, graduated repayment, extended repayment, and income-driven repayment.</p><p>Even if you're not merging finances, Farrington encourages couples to help each other through this planning phase.</p><p>“You should be open and helping each other,” he says. “Maybe not monetarily before marriage, but definitely in managing the loans, tracking expenses and plans, and helping navigate the various repayment plan options. Finances should be a team sport, including student loans.”</p><h3>How does marriage impact income-driven repayment?</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">Income-driven repayment plans</a> adjust your monthly student loan payments in accordance with your income and family size. If you get married, your monthly payments could increase, since your payments will be based on a new, higher income if you file taxes together.</p><p>If you want your payments based solely on your income, consider filing your taxes separately, rather than jointly. Keep in mind, though, that filing separately could cost you in other ways.</p><p>“Choosing 'married filing separately' often increases your tax liability, frequently outweighing any student loan savings, particularly for higher earners,” says Meisenheimer.</p><p>Filing separately may also limit your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA, which could impact your retirement savings.</p><p>“The key is to look at the numbers — how much more in taxes you'll pay, versus how much less in student loans you'll pay,” says Farrington. “You don't want to save $100 per month in student loans, but find out you increased your tax bill by $2,000.”</p><p>If you're considering filing separately, it may help to first do a cost-benefit analysis with a tax professional.</p><h2>Explore avenues for student loan forgiveness</h2><p>You may not have to pay back your full balance if you can qualify for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">loan forgiveness</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> program, for example, will forgive your loans after 10 years of working in public service if you meet certain requirements. Teacher Loan Forgiveness offers up to $17,500 in debt cancellation after teaching for five years at a low-income school or educational service agency. Some states and companies also offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">loan repayment assistance</a> to qualifying professionals. Explore your options to see if you could get help chipping away at your student loan debt.</p><h2>Consider refinancing for a better interest rate</h2><p>Another loan repayment strategy is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">student loan refinancing</a>. Refinancing involves exchanging one or more of your loans for a new one that ideally has a better interest rate. You can also choose a new repayment term length, which will adjust your monthly payments.</p><p>Refinancing has the potential to save you money, but you'll need decent credit and a stable income to qualify (or a creditworthy cosigner). <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/refinance-federal-student-loans\">Refinancing federal loans</a> also has the major downside of forfeiting federal repayment plans, forgiveness programs, and other benefits.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:12050":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"12050","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"compare-rates"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:261278":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"261278","content":"<h2>Get transparent about your student loan debt</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/mental-health-tips-student-loans\">Student loans can cause stress</a> in a relationship, especially if one person owes a lot more than the other.

Once you graduate, leave school, or fall below half-time enrollment, you’ll enter a grace period that typically lasts six months. After that point, you’ll be responsible for making principal and interest payments that pay down your student loan balance.</p><h3>Contact your school’s financial aid office</h3><p>Since policies can differ significantly from school to school, it’s vital that you check with your financial aid office before dropping a class. Many colleges and universities provide their definition of satisfactory academic progress online and offer examples of how dropping a class can affect your standing.</p><p>You can also make an in-person appointment with the financial aid office if you’d like help navigating the rules and how they apply to your situation.</p><h2>How does dropping a class impact student loans?</h2><p>Private student loans generally are not tied to “satisfactory academic progress.” You typically won't risk losing any&nbsp;private student loans&nbsp;for failing to complete two-thirds of your classes. If dropping a class causes you to lose some or all of your federal financial aid, private loans may help you fill in the gaps.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:305618":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"305618","content":"<p>Many private student loans require you to be enrolled at least half-time.

These often include personal loans, credit card cash advances, cash advance apps, payday loans, title loans, and pawnshop loans. But if there's an emergency purchase you can put on a credit card or BNPL plan, those are options too.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted, not all emergency loans are the same. They can differ in terms of cost, available loan amounts, access and eligibility, funding time, repayment terms, and more.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301462":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301462","content":"<h2>How do emergency loans work?</h2><p>Each type of emergency loan functions differently. Here is a breakdown of some of the different forms of emergency loans:</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> is a monthly installment loan that's typically unsecured, meaning no collateral required. Repayment terms typically range from two years to seven years, loan amounts may be available from $1,000 to $50,000 (or more), depending on the lender. Qualification hinges on your credit score, income, and other financial factors. If you qualify, you'll receive a lump sum upfront. Then you'll pay it back, plus interest, via monthly payments over the loan's term.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>Some banks, like U.S. Bank and Bank of America, offer small short-term loans up to $1,000 to existing account holders that can be deposited the same day. Loans are typically paid back over three months and often don't require a credit check. Fees are reasonable too for no-credit-check loans — in the examples above, they're below 36% APR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loan</a> &nbsp;are available from certain federal credit unions, these loans were developed as an affordable alternative to pricey payday loans. They're available in amounts up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to a year, depending on the type of PAL. Rates are capped at 28%.&nbsp;</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><strong>\"</strong>Buy now, pay later” apps, or <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL</a>, offer a way to make purchases now and pay them off, interest-free, over 6 weeks or longer, depending on the app. Companies like Affirm and Klarna are widely available for use in almost any retail setting, from grocery stores to veterinarians. Some apps also offer longer-term repayment plans, similar to personal loans, with APRs up to 36%. Purchases are instant and a hard credit check is typically not required for short-term plans, but may be for longer ones.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">Cash advance apps</a> look at your banking activity to determine how much of an advance to extend, typically no more than $750. Like payday loans, repayment is often pulled from your next paycheck. Though some cash advance apps don't require fees, it's the optional fees that can make them expensive — like tips and instant funding fees. The Center for Responsible Lending found that the average APR for a cash advance repaid in 7 to 14 days was 367%.</p><h3>Credit card cash advance</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p>A cash advance from your credit card allows you to withdraw cash in a pinch from an ATM. But you'll have to pay a cash advance fee, and interest is typically charged immediately. Plus, the APR on cash advances is usually higher than your card's purchase APR.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more is that if you carry a balance on your card, your minimum payments may go toward paying down interest and fees along with your lowest-interest balance first — meaning you should pay more than your minimum payment to pay off a credit card cash advance as soon as possible. Alternatively, you could use a personal loan to pay off the credit card and get a lower APR and longer repayment term.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pawnshop loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loan</a> should not be your first choice, but may be a better choice than a payday loan or title loan. Consider only if you can't qualify for a personal loan or longer-term option, and have an item to pawn that you won't miss and don't need. APRs are high, but if you don't pay the loan back, the pawnshop simply keeps your collateral — the loan doesn't go to collections, and your credit won't be damaged.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> is often a no-credit-check loan due with your next paycheck. You can generally borrow up to $500. But fees amount to triple-digit APRs in most states where they're legal, and are over 600% APR in some. In most cases, there are better loan options.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">title loan</a> is a short-term loan that uses your vehicle title as collateral. Typically, loan amounts are up to 50% of your car's value, and APRs can be as high as 300% — they're not legal in every state.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301466":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301466","content":"<h2>How to compare emergency loans</h2><p>Consider these factors when comparing types of emergency loans — such as a cash advance vs. a payday loan — or multiple loans of the same type, such as personal loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider the APR:</strong> A loan's <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, or APR, indicates the overall cost of the loan on an annual basis. It takes both the interest rate and any upfront fees — like origination fees — into account. If you're looking at loans that charge fees instead of interest, use a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> to calculate the APR. You can compare APRs across loan types this way.</li><li><strong>Compare monthly payments:</strong> The monthly payment is key because it needs to be affordable to avoid costly late fees and renewal fees. For instance, if you <a href=\"/personal-loan/500-loan\">need to borrow $500</a> now but can't afford to pay it back in 2 to 4 weeks, a payday loan or cash advance would be a bad idea. Instead, look for a longer-term loan, such as a personal loan, payday alternative loan from a credit union, or BNPL if possible.</li><li><strong>Look at available loan amounts:</strong> The <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">amount you need to borrow</a> can indicate the type of loan you should get. For instance, if you need to borrow more than $1,000, personal loans, credit card cash advances, and payday alternative loans may be your only options.</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms:</strong> Depending on the type of emergency loan, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">terms can range</a> from 2 weeks to 7 years. Make sure you can afford to make payments for the duration of the loan's term.</li><li><strong>Compare </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\"><strong>funding times</strong></a><strong>:</strong> What makes an emergency loan an emergency loan is that it delivers money fast. Some emergency loans can get you money instantly (or almost). But these often have the highest fees and APRs. If you feel you have to get a payday loan, title loan, or other high-fee loan, try applying for a personal loan as well. If approved, you could use it to pay off the emergency loan and any other high-interest debt.</li><li><strong>Know if a credit check is required:</strong> Even if you're credit-check-averse, know that <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">no-credit-check loans</a> often have the highest fees and most predatory terms. In fact, most loans that don't require a credit check are the kind that have triple-digit APRs. Prequalify with personal loan lenders (with a soft credit check) or check your spending power with BNPL apps like Affirm to see if you might qualify for a lower-cost loan with much better terms.</li><li><strong>Review lender reputation:</strong> Check out customer reviews via sites like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau, and Google reviews.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301470":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301470","content":"<p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>How to get an emergency loan</h2><p>The easiest loans to get are often the ones you want to avoid. Still, even easy loans have minimum requirements you'll need to meet.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare lenders and loan types:</strong> Compare APRs, terms, and funding times (along with any fees for fast funding) across the loan types and lenders you're considering. Remember that <a href=\"/personal-loan/interest-free-loans\">zero-interest loans don't mean “free”</a> and could be much more expensive than a loan with a high interest rate.</li><li><strong>Have sufficient income:</strong> Most lenders want to know your income to decide whether to lend to you and how much, based on your ability to afford payments. Many have minimum income requirements and require proof of income, as well.</li><li><strong>Meet the minimum credit score:</strong> If you're getting a loan that requires a hard credit check, find out the lender's <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirement</a> before applying, and know your own credit score. You can get your Equifax FICO Score 8 for free monthly through <a href=\"https://www.myfico.com/\">myfico.com</a>, or check your score for free with Credible's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score?utm_source=credible_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fbest-emergency-loans\">credit monitoring tool</a>. You might find a lender's minimum credit score requirement in their FAQ or on a personal loan marketplace. Not all disclose it, however.</li><li><strong>Calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> Your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> is a measure of your monthly debt relative to your gross monthly income. Some lenders, like personal loan lenders, use it to determine how much room you have in your budget for a new debt payment. A DTI below 36% is generally preferred for personal loans, although some lenders consider up to 55%. Add up all your minimum monthly debt payments, and divide that by your gross monthly income (before taxes) — the percentage is your DTI.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> If you apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>, you'll need collateral. In the case of a title loan, this would be your car title. Some personal loan lenders, like <a href=\"/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a>, also offer loans secured by your car, but with much lower rates than title loans. Also, note that borrowers in certain states may be subject to minimum or maximum loan amounts.</li><li><strong>Prequalify for a personal loan</strong>: Use a personal loan marketplace like Credible to prequalify with multiple lenders, or prequalify individually on lender sites. This step takes minutes and gives you an idea of the rates, terms, and loan amount each lender might approve you for. Even if you don't choose a personal loan, it can give you a good base for comparison with other loan types.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">How To Apply for a Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301474":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301474","content":"<p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How to Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Alternatives to emergency loans</h2><p>Sometimes an emergency loan isn't the best way to pay for unexpected expenses.

But regardless of the amount, know whether the money you need is in the form of a gift or loan. If it's the latter, clearly document the repayment terms, interest rate, payment amount, and schedule, and the recourse for the lender if you miss payments.</li><li><strong>Paycheck advance:</strong> Check with your HR department to see if a paycheck advance is available. This can be a relatively affordable way to borrow money short-term, as employers aren't allowed to profit from loans to employees.</li><li><strong>401(k) loan or emergency withdrawal</strong>: This type of loan or withdrawal could take a few days to a week to process. But if your plan allows 401(k) loans, you could borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if 50% of your vested account balance is less than $10,000. All plans allow you to withdraw $1,000 one time annually for an emergency expense.</li><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong>: There are a number of crowdfunding platforms for paying a wide range of expenses from medical and vet bills to rent.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">loan amount you qualify for</a> is typically based on your credit profile, income, debt, and other factors.</p><p>To compare personal loans, start by figuring out how much you need to borrow. Then, request quotes from lenders with suitable loan amount ranges and see which offers the loan amount you need. If none do, look for the amount that’s closest.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Weigh fees and penalties</h2><p>It’s also important to understand the fees personal loan lenders charge. Fees will add to your borrowing costs and can make or break a loan offer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Origination fees</h3><p>The first fee to watch out for is an origination fee, also known as an administration fee.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">Personal loan origination fees</a> can range from less than 1% to as much as 15% of the loan amount and are typically deducted from loan funds before you receive them.</p><p>For example, if you get a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/5k-loans\">$5,000 loan</a> with a 5% upfront origination fee, you’d receive only $4,750 but would have to repay the full $5,000.</p><p>Though origination fees are common for personal loans, some online lenders, banks, and credit unions offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">loans with no origination fees</a>.

Lenders may charge you a per-incident fee if your payments are late or returned.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <a href=\"/personal-loan/upstart-personal-loans-review\">Upstart</a> may charge a fee equal to $15 or 5% of the past-due amount, whichever is greater, if you don’t make a payment within 10 days of its due date. Additionally, you may face a charge of $15 per occurrence for returned checks or ACH payments.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a good idea to check a lender’s payment-related fees and grace periods, or windows of time during which you can make payments late without penalty.</p><h2>4. Consider repayment terms</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">Personal loan repayment terms</a> typically range from two to seven years, but some lenders offer terms of 10 years or more.&nbsp;</p><p>Choosing the right term for your budget is important.

Each month, you make payments toward your principal and interest.</p><p>Personal loans are usually amortized. This means that as you repay your loan and your balance decreases, you’ll go from paying mostly interest to making larger payments toward your principal balance each month.

Check customer service availability</h2><p>Check to see if you’re comfortable with the support channels and service hours a lender offers in case you have a question about or an issue with your loan. A good place to start is a lender’s contact page on its website.&nbsp;</p><p>Options may include: a support phone line (generally with limited business hours), 24/7 live chat services, a secure messaging platform, email services, and/or in-person support at branches.&nbsp;</p><h2>11.

For example:</p><p>Bank of America’s Balance Assist loans are available up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and no interest. The loan is repaid in three equal monthly installments automatically from your Bank of America checking account, making it a much better option than payday loans and even cash apps for short-term borrowing.</p><p>U.S. Bank’s Simple Loan provides loans up to $1,000, also repaid in three monthly installments.

PALs are available from many federal credit unions and are designed to be utilized instead of payday loans.</p><p>Amounts can range up to $2,000, and repayment terms can extend to 12 months.

That might not sound like much, but it’s the same as paying a nearly 300% APR. The lender may charge additional fees to roll over the loan from month to month if you can’t pay it off, making the cost of borrowing even higher.</p><h3>401(k) loans</h3><p><strong>Avoid if possible</strong></p><p>Some 401(k) plan providers let you <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\">borrow against your own retirement account</a>. Loans are usually limited to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. And you typically have five years to repay the loan, usually via payroll deductions, unless you leave your job. In that case, you may need to pay the remaining balance immediately or face tax consequences and early withdrawal penalties.</p><p>The good news is that the interest you pay goes back into your account, and it’s usually set at 1% to 2% plus the prime rate — which is likely much lower than any other interest rate you’ll get, especially with bad credit.

Here are some of the most important things to take into account when considering your options.</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong> The annual percentage rate, or <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>, is a great way to compare loan options apples to apples. The APR accounts for both upfront fees and interest to show you the total cost of the loan, expressed on an annual basis.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> An <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is a common cost associated with a personal loan that is often deducted from the loan amount before it’s disbursed to you. Depending on the lender, an origination fee could be as high as 12%, but not all lenders charge them.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> A repayment term is <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">how long you have to repay the loan</a>. For hardship loans, this can vary widely, from 2 weeks for payday loans and cash advance apps, to multiple years for personal loans and 401(k) loans. Repayment terms are important because, generally speaking, the shorter the repayment term, the higher the monthly payment amount.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\"><strong>Amount</strong></a><strong>:</strong> It will be easier to qualify for a very small amount of money, like a sum under $500, as neither payday loan lenders nor cash advance apps typically consider your credit. Even if you qualify for a personal loan or other installment loan that runs your credit, you may still not qualify for a large amount if the lender doesn’t feel confident that you can repay it.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Credit score</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A low credit score can affect your borrowing options, putting many affordable loans out of reach. Loans like payday loans and title loans that don’t weigh your credit score are usually high-cost and high-risk borrowing options.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-do-personal-loans-work\">How Do Personal Loans Work?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:292098":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"292098","content":"<h2>How to get a hardship loan with bad credit</h2><p>If you have a low credit score, you’re not without options. Here are some things to consider when applying for loans:</p><ul><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> Putting up collateral (like your car) to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">secure a personal loan</a> can increase the amount you're eligible to borrow, lower the cost of the loan, or help you qualify. OneMain Financial, Upgrade, and Reprise are all recommended lenders that offer secured loans, but not all personal loan lenders do. If you miss payments, you could lose your collateral.</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner:</strong> A handful of lenders, like OneMain Financial, allow you to apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">loan with a cosigner</a>. A cosigner should be someone with a good credit profile who will take on responsibility for the loan with you — if you don't pay, they're on the hook.</li><li><strong>Apply with a joint applicant: </strong>If you'll be using the loan for joint needs, like a new appliance or home repair for you and your partner, it could help to apply for the loan together. This way, the lender will consider your joint applicant's income and credit as well as yours.</li><li><strong>Look for low credit score requirements:</strong> Some lenders offer loans to borrowers with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-credit-history-loans\">low or no credit </a>scores. Look for lenders with low minimum credit score requirements and prequalify with them before choosing a higher-risk option.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If a close friend or family member has good credit and is willing to make you an authorized user on their credit card, it could go a long way to improving your credit score. This, in turn, could help you qualify for a loan.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to hardship loans</h2><p>If you’re struggling to qualify for a personal loan or PAL and don’t want to take out a riskier loan, consider other options:</p><ul><li><strong>Grants and financial assistance:</strong> If you are struggling to make rent, pay for medical expenses, or afford basic necessities like food and utilities, you may be eligible for financial assistance. Use the search feature at <a href=\"https://www.211.org/about-us/your-local-211\">211.org</a> to see what’s available in your area.</li><li><strong>A family member or friend:</strong> If you have someone in your life who would be willing to help, it may be worth it to reach out. Come to a mutually agreeable repayment schedule with specific dates for when payments are due — and make a record of it for both of you to reference.</li><li><strong>401(k) $1,000 emergency withdrawal:</strong> If your plan allows, you can withdraw up to $1,000 for an emergency personal expense without penalty once per year. You’ll still need to pay income tax on the withdrawn amount, but can avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty that’s typically assessed if you’re under 59 ½.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\"><strong>Debt management plan</strong></a><strong> (DMP):</strong> Either as an alternative to or in conjunction with a hardship loan, a DMP through a credit counselor could lower your current monthly debt payments and/or save money on interest — potentially freeing up cash so that you don’t have to borrow.</li><li><strong>BNPL:</strong> If you need to borrow money to make a purchase, a buy now, pay later app may be a good option. BNPL apps like Affirm and Klarna have looser credit requirements than personal loans, and may only run a soft credit check when you apply. Interest and fees can be low or $0, especially if you choose a pay-in-4 plan over 6 weeks. But you typically will need to make the first installment upfront.</li></ul><h2>How to improve your credit</h2><p>Getting a loan is&nbsp;much easier if you don’t have bad credit. But it often takes time to improve your credit — which you may not have if you’re facing a hardship now. So in addition to tried and true ways of improving your credit long-term, we’ll cover a couple of quick-win ways to boost your score within a month.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quick credit boosters</h3><ul><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> As noted above, becoming an authorized user on the credit card of someone with good credit can improve your credit score. How? Because their credit card account — including payment history and available credit — is typically reported on&nbsp;your credit report once you become an authorized user. And most credit card companies report monthly, meaning you could see your score improve within one month.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a rent- and utility-reporting service:</strong> Services like Experian Boost report your on-time rent and other payments (like utilities and cell service) to one or more credit bureaus, which can increase your score almost instantly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ask for a credit line increase:</strong> If one or more of your credit card balances are high, but you’ve been making on-time payments, you may be able to request and be approved for a credit line increase. This can help reduce your credit utilization, and thereby increase your score once the new credit limit is reported (typically, within one month).</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:292110":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"292110","content":"<h3>Long-term credit gains</h3><ul><li><strong>Make payments on time: </strong>Since payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score, making payments on time is the single most important thing you can do to raise your score and keep it up.</li><li><strong>Keep credit utilization low:</strong> Since credit utilization — the amount of credit you’re using compared to the amount you have —&nbsp; contributes up to 30% to your score, keeping it low or reducing it can result in big credit score gains. In addition to quick-win ways of lowering credit utilization, work on paying down your credit card balances. Or better yet, don’t run them up in the first place.</li><li><strong>Get a credit builder loan:</strong> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">credit builder loan</a> works like a loan in reverse. Instead of getting all the money you borrow upfront, you receive it once the loan is paid in full. As a result, these types of loans are much easier to get approved for and can help your score since payments are reported to the credit bureaus.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get a secured credit card:</strong> Unlike a typical unsecured credit card, you’ll need to put down a security deposit to get a secured credit card.

You can also often get generous cash back rewards on your first day of purchases when approved for the card.</p><p>In-store financing can be a good option if you need an appliance quickly, don’t have the funds on hand, and can pay the balance off in full within the promotional period. The last part is important because some promotional financing offers charge deferred interest. For instance, the same Best Buy credit card above will charge interest on the balance <i>from the purchase date</i> if you don't pay the balance in full within 18 months.

As a result, you could end up paying more than the original cost of the appliance with a rent-to-own offer.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you might decide to get a refrigerator with a sticker price of $1,500.

If you can pay off the loan during that time, this perk could help you save hundreds in interest costs over the life of the loan.</li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li><strong>Can be expensive:</strong> Depending on the type of appliance financing and your credit, you could pay much more to finance an appliance compared to paying cash, especially if you have bad credit or need a repayment term longer than one year.</li><li><strong>Deferred interest:</strong> 0% interest promotions expire after a certain number of months. If the loan isn’t paid within that time frame, you may have to pay deferred interest on the entire purchase amount from the date of purchase, based on the loan’s or card’s standard APR. In other words, any gains you saw from paying 0% interest would be immediately erased.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Appliance financing alternatives</h2><p>Here are some financing alternatives for appliance financing.</p><ul><li><strong>Layaway plans:</strong> If you can wait, you could potentially put your appliance on a layaway plan and pay it off over time with no interest. But you may have to put down a deposit and fees. The deposit can be a set amount or a percentage. With layaway plans, you only get the item once it’s paid in full.</li><li><strong>Save up:</strong> Consider setting aside extra funds monthly to save up for the appliance if you don’t need it right away. This can save you money on borrowing costs and help you avoid any fees associated with a layaway plan.</li><li><strong>Appliance repair:</strong> If you have an appliance that broke, it might not need to be replaced, but only repaired. Contact an appliance repair company for rates, and determine whether it’s worth it.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:282026":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"282026","content":"<p>Nearly 300,000 federal student loan borrowers are receiving forgiveness through a landmark class-action settlement. This agreement stems from a lawsuit originally filed as Sweet v. DeVos (later renamed Sweet v. Cardona, and then Sweet v. McMahon, for subsequent U.S. education secretaries), which challenged the Department of Education's (ED) handling of borrower defense claims. Borrowers argued the Department had delayed or unfairly denied applications from students who claimed their schools misled them.</p><p>Under the settlement, many loans have already been discharged, and additional decisions and discharges will continue through Jan. 28, 2026.</p><p>If you're covered under the Sweet student loan settlement — or if you've submitted a borrower defense claim that's still pending or was denied — here's what you need to know about how the settlement works and what comes next.</p><h2>What is the Sweet student loan settlement?</h2><p>The Sweet student loan settlement is a class-action lawsuit brought by federal student loan borrowers in June 2019. The borrowers claimed they were misled or defrauded by certain schools and then denied the relief they were entitled to under borrower defense.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged the ED acted in bad faith by ignoring claims or issuing blanket denials without thoroughly reviewing the evidence.</p><p>“Sweet v. Cardona was a notable lawsuit because it exposed the Department of Education for dragging its feet and unfairly denying student loan forgiveness requests,” says Leslie Tayne, Esq., managing director of Tayne Law Group, noting that the student requests included proof that the schools misled or took advantage of them.</p><p>“It also clarified that students have the right to loan forgiveness when they've been misled and that the government must treat those claims seriously, fairly, and transparently.”</p><p>The final settlement was approved on Nov. 16, 2022. The ED has been issuing relief to eligible borrowers since then.</p><h2>Who qualifies under Sweet student loan forgiveness?</h2><p>You may be eligible for student loan forgiveness under the Sweet student loan settlement if:</p><ul><li>Your borrower defense claim was denied between December 2019 and October 2020, or</li><li>Your borrower defense application was pending as of June 22, 2022.</li></ul><p>If either applies, you're considered a class member under the Sweet student loan lawsuit.</p><p>Class members are divided into two groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic relief group: </strong>This includes borrowers whose applications were tied to one of the listed schools in the settlement.
