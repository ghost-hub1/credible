That includes time spent in certain types of forbearance or deferment, or on the wrong repayment plan.</p><h2>How does PSLF buyback work?</h2><p>Eligible borrowers can make a one-time payment to “buy back” months spent in deferment or forbearance and have them count toward the 120 qualifying payments required for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. This can help accelerate forgiveness if progress was delayed by servicing errors or periods of deferment and forbearance, such as the mandatory <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">SAVE Plan</a> forbearance.</p><p>The amount you'll pay depends on what your monthly payment would have been under an income-driven repayment plan during the months you're buying back, typically based on your income at the time.</p><p>“If their income has increased since then, the monthly payments now may be higher, so buying back the old payments may save them money,” explains Mark Kantrowitz, financial aid expert and author of “How to Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>If you're not on an IDR plan, your loan servicer will ask for your tax returns to estimate what your payments would have been during the buyback period. They'll base the amount on your documented income at the time, and may adjust it to reflect any changes in family size.</p><h2>Who qualifies?</h2><p>PSLF buyback is best suited for borrowers with large loan balances who are nearing the end of their forgiveness timeline.</p><p>“If you were working in the public sector but, due to a technicality, were not earning PSLF credit, this program could be a big help,” says William Bevins, a certified financial planner (CFP) in Franklin, Tennessee.</p><p>You must meet the following requirements to qualify:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan type: </strong>You must have Direct Loans or consolidate an eligible federal loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan.</li><li><strong>Employment: </strong>You must have worked full-time for a qualifying government organization or a 501(c)(3) nonprofit for at least 120 months.</li><li><strong>Repayment status: </strong>Any months you're attempting to buy back must be during periods when your loans were in repayment, but the time didn't count — either due to a technical error, loan servicing issue, or certain types of forbearance or deferment, such as the mandatory SAVE Plan forbearance.</li></ul><h2>How to apply</h2><p>If you meet the eligibility requirements, here's how to apply for PSLF buyback:</p><ul><li><strong>Certify your past employment:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/pslf/\">PSLF Help Tool</a> to certify any months of eligible employment that haven't been recorded yet.</li><li><strong>Verify the months you want to buy back: </strong>Identify which months of deferment or forbearance you want credit for, and ensure you were working for a qualified employer during that time.</li><li><strong>Submit your request:</strong> Go to the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/pslf/reconsideration/borrower-information\">PSLF Reconsideration portal </a>and submit a request. The Department of Education asks that you include the following statement: “I have at least 120 months of approved qualifying employment, and I am seeking PSLF or TEPSLF discharge through PSLF buyback. Please assess my eligibility for PSLF buyback.”</li><li><strong>Review the buyback agreement:</strong> If you qualify, you'll receive a buyback agreement outlining the amount due and payment instructions.

You receive a lump sum of money upfront and repay it, plus interest, in agreed-upon amounts on a monthly schedule. These loans often have better rates than other options, but may be difficult to qualify for if you have a poor credit history.</li><li><strong>Credit card advances:</strong> Credit cards sometimes allow you to withdraw cash at a bank or ATM — this is called a cash advance. These withdrawals are often limited to a certain percentage of your total line of credit, generally have a higher interest rate than a normal credit card purchase and come with expensive fees.</li><li><strong>Employee cash advance:</strong> If your employer allows it, you can borrow small amounts from an upcoming paycheck. Although laws prohibit employers from profiting from a payroll advance, you could have to pay fees to help cover administrative costs.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Typically, cash advance apps don’t have an APR, but may instead charge subscription fees or fast funding fees, depending on the app. Some apps may encourage voluntary tipping.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These are short-term loans for small amounts, usually due to be repaid in full on your next payday. They often come with extremely high interest rates and fees — 400% APR is a common rate. These loans have a bad reputation, and have been regulated or outright prohibited in many states.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\"><strong>Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some pawnshops offer short-term loans secured by material assets, such as sporting goods, jewelry, or electronics. The size of the loan is based on the assessed value of the item used as collateral, which the pawnshop holds until the loan is repaid. If the borrower defaults, the pawnshop keeps the item.

Some lenders offer same-day funding, but others may take a few business days to get the money to you. Unfortunately, lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day personal loans</a> typically require good credit or better.&nbsp;</p><h3>Compare APRs</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">Annual percentage rate (APR)</a> measures the annual cost of borrowing, combining both the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rate</a> and any upfront fees. APRs for poor credit tend to be high, so compare your loan options to find one that is competitive and that you can afford.&nbsp;</p><h3>Consider fees</h3><p>Many personal loan lenders charge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> that can range from 0% to 15% of the loan amount and are typically deducted upfront. With options like cash advances and payday loans, fees can make borrowing very expensive. Make sure you count these expenses when considering the total cost of borrowing.</p><h3>Look at loan amounts</h3><p>If you have a low credit score or carry a lot of existing debt, it may be difficult to borrow the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">loan amount</a> you need, and you may be offered a smaller amount instead. Compare lenders to see if one will lend you the amount you need.</p><h3>Compare repayment terms</h3><p>Some options, like payday loans, have very short repayment terms of just a couple of weeks, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">personal loan repayment terms</a> typically last 2 to 7 years. Credit card cash advances can take months or years to repay. Generally speaking, the shorter the repayment term, the higher your monthly payment will be and the less interest you’ll pay (though this isn’t always the case, especially with payday loans and other extremely high-APR options).</p><h3>Find out if secured loans are available</h3><p>If you’re struggling to get approved for an unsecured personal loan, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loan</a> could help you qualify. Only a few lenders offer them (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/reprise-personal-loans-review\">Reprise</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a>), and note that the collateral you use to secure the loan is at risk if you default.</p><h3>Seek lenders that allow cosigners</h3><p>If you can find a cosigner with a good credit score and positive financial history to help guarantee your loan, you may qualify for better rates. Finding a qualified co-applicant for a joint personal loan, where you share access to the loan and responsibility for repayment, could help in similar ways. However, not many lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loans with cosigners</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\">joint personal loans</a> (with exceptions including OneMain Financial and Reprise).</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:291726":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"291726","content":"<h2>Personal loan rates for bad credit</h2><p>People with bad credit scores, generally defined as FICO scores below 580, typically pay higher personal loan APRs than people with better credit.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors.

The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee.

The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs. If you default, the lender can repossess your vehicle.</p><p>Similar to payday loans, rolling over a title loan can literally mean buying time.

Unlike a home equity loan, which comes with a one-time lump sum payment, a HELOC allows you to continue borrowing and repaying the funds over several years.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two distinct phases of taking out a HELOC — a draw period and a repayment period. The draw period typically lasts 10 years, and during this time, you can spend up to your credit limit without needing to repay anything.</p><p>Once the draw period ends, you’ll stop borrowing funds from your HELOC and enter the repayment period. This period lasts 10 to 20 years, and you’ll make monthly payments to pay down the balance.</p><h2>Can you use a HELOC to pay off your mortgage?</h2><p>Yes, you can use a HELOC to pay off your mortgage, but it may not be the best option. “I would not recommend using a HELOC to pay off a mortgage,” said Jennifer Beeston, SVP of mortgage lending at Rate.&nbsp;</p><p>“HELOCs traditionally have higher rates than fixed mortgages, and most are variable. It’s a higher-risk product with higher rates so I see zero reason to use it to pay off a fixed mortgage.”</p><p>According to Becky Conner-McDuffy, a senior loan advisor at Penny Lane Financial, a HELOC can be used for almost anything, from consolidating debt to paying for home improvements. But she says using one to pay off your mortgage depends heavily on interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>“With HELOCs tied to the prime rate and often adjusted for credit scores and loan-to-value ratios, they typically carry higher rates than traditional mortgages,\" she explains. For that reason, she doesn’t advise this strategy either.</p><h2>Pros and cons of using a HELOC to pay off your mortgage</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:201798":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"201798","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Low interest rates:</strong> “If current HELOC rates are lower than your mortgage interest rate, you could save money by using a HELOC to refinance your mortgage debt,” said Steven Kibbel, CFP®, ChFC®, and CLU®. “This is especially true if you’re locked into a higher fixed rate on your current loan.”</li><li><strong>Flexible payments:</strong> Kibbel says that many HELOCs offer interest-only payments during the initial draw period, which can significantly reduce monthly outlays. “This breathing room might be useful if you’re anticipating a financial windfall or simply need some extra liquidity in the short term,” he added.</li><li><strong>Access to additional funds:</strong> A HELOC also leaves you with access to any remaining credit, which can be helpful with home improvements, debt consolidation, and other financial priorities.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Upfront costs: </strong>Depending on your lender, there may be upfront costs associated with taking out a HELOC. You might be responsible for appraisal and application fees, as well as closing costs. Each of these fees will add to the total cost of the loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Variable interest rates: </strong>Because HELOCs usually come with variable interest rates, your payments can change from month to month. This lack of predictability can make it harder to budget for your monthly repayments.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your home is collateral: </strong>A HELOC is secured using your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-home-equity\">home equity</a>, so if you’re unable to make the loan payments, you could lose your home. You should only consider a HELOC if you’re confident you can handle the repayments.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How to qualify</h2><p>Before you can decide whether using a HELOC to pay off your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage\">mortgage</a> makes sense, you need to qualify for the loan.

Most lenders look for a max LTV ratio of 85%. You can increase your LTV ratio by paying down your mortgage or by waiting for your property values to go up.</li><li><strong>Improve your credit score: </strong>Your credit score is one of the main factors lenders consider when evaluating you for a loan since it indicates that you’re less of a lending risk. You can improve your credit score by paying down any outstanding debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider using a cosigner: </strong>If your credit score isn’t as high as you’d like, you might consider applying with a creditworthy cosigner. You can take advantage of that individual’s high credit score to help you qualify for the loan.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to consider</h2><p>Before taking out a HELOC to pay off your mortgage, you might consider refinancing your existing mortgage. When you refinance, you pay off your current mortgage with a new loan.</p><p>Refinancing may be a good option if you can qualify for lower interest rates than what you currently have. You can also change your loan terms — for example, you could switch from a 30-year mortgage to 15-year loan terms, thus paying off your mortgage faster.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance-programs-for-seniors\">Seniors</a>&nbsp;can also consider a reverse mortgage, which allows them to borrow money using their home as security for the loan.

Use the remaining amount to determine what you can afford for monthly payments, as well as how much you can save for a down payment. A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">mortgage affordability calculator</a> can help you set a budget.</li><li><strong>Do a credit check: </strong>Your credit history and credit score will play a major part in your loan application, so request a copy of your credit report and review it ahead of time. If you have late payments, collection efforts, or other negative events on your report, address those before you apply, as they could hurt your chances. Plus, if there are any fraudulent accounts or errors in your report, you can dispute them with the reporting credit bureau.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved:</strong> It helps to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">get pre-approved for a mortgage</a> before searching for a home. When you apply for pre-approval, the lender reviews your credit history and borrower profile and gives you a letter describing the loan terms and amounts you’re likely to be approved for later. A pre-approval letter can give you a good price range to shop in and give sellers more confidence when you make offers.</li><li><strong>Compare rates and mortgage offers:</strong> Next, you’ll want to compare options. Pay close attention to the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/apr-vs-interest-rate\">interest rate and APR</a> you’re being offered, the closing costs, and any fees the lender is charging.</li><li><strong>Find and make an offer on a home: </strong>When you find a home you want to buy, submit your pre-approval letter with your offer, and work with an experienced real estate agent to get the best deal.</li><li><strong>Complete the full mortgage application: </strong>After your offer has been accepted, fill out your lender’s full mortgage application and submit the documentation it requires, such as tax returns, bank statements, and pay stubs. You will also need to agree to a credit check.</li><li><strong>Await approval: </strong>Your loan will then go into <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">underwriting</a>, which is when your lender verifies your income, savings, and other assets and makes sure you can repay the loan. The lender will also order an appraisal to gauge the home’s value (and make sure it’s worth the money you’re requesting to borrow for it).</li><li><strong>Get ready for closing: </strong>Once your loan is nearing full approval, you’ll get a closing date, which is when you’ll sign the final paperwork and receive your keys. You’ll typically need proof of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/home-insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need\">homeowners insurance</a> by this day, so be sure to shop around for your policy early.</li><li><strong>Close on your loan: </strong>When closing day rolls around, you’ll attend your appointment and sign the required paperwork.

Nearly all lenders can issue a qualified mortgage.</li><li>The loan is not a subprime mortgage. Subprime mortgages are high-risk home loans generally offered to borrowers with lower credit scores. They carry interest rates that exceed market-value rates for well-qualified borrowers.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15322","content":"<h3>Types of prepayment penalties</h3><p>There are two types of prepayment penalties — soft prepayment penalties and hard prepayment penalties. Here’s a quick breakdown of the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Soft prepay penalty:</strong> This applies to refinances only. You can sell your home or otherwise pay off the mortgage early without incurring a penalty.</li><li><strong>Hard prepay penalty:</strong> This applies to prepayment by any means.</li></ul><p>The type of prepayment penalty you’ll pay may depend on the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/types-of-mortgage-loans\">type of mortgage</a> you get and your lender’s practices.</p><h3>Limits on prepayment penalties</h3><p>On fixed-rate qualified mortgages, lenders can include a prepayment penalty clause during the first three years, with limits on the size of the fee. But they must also offer an alternative loan that does not include prepayment penalty fees such as an FHA loan or ARM.</p><h2>How a prepayment penalty works</h2><p>You’ll know whether your loan has a prepayment penalty clause by looking at your monthly statement or payment coupons. If your loan is an older ARM, your rate adjustment notices should also indicate the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty.</p><p>In the event your loan is subject to a prepayment penalty, any action on your part that results in full repayment can trigger the penalty. Say, for example, you refinance your mortgage. The refinance is a new first mortgage that replaces your current loan by repaying it in full. That repayment could trigger the penalty.</p><p>The same is true if you sell your home. Since mortgages must be repaid in full if you decide to sell your home, that could trigger a prepayment penalty depending on the terms of your loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15330","content":"<h2>How much are prepayment penalties?</h2><p>Prepayment penalties vary with each lender, but here are some typical formulas for determining this fee:</p><ul><li><strong>Percentage of the outstanding loan balance: </strong>You may be required to pay a small percentage, such as 2%, of the remaining loan balance when paying off the loan within the first two or three years of the loan term. For example, if you owe $200,000 and the penalty fee is 2%, you pay a $4,000 prepayment penalty. Your lender may limit your prepayment penalty to a certain dollar amount, though.</li><li><strong>Interest for a certain number of months:</strong> Some lenders base the penalty fee on the amount of interest you would have paid had you kept the loan longer. For example, you might be required to pay six months’ worth of interest if you refinance.</li><li><strong>Flat fee: </strong>You might be required to pay a fixed amount, such as $2,000, to pay off the loan before the term ends.</li><li><strong>Sliding scale:</strong> This model is based on the length of the loan term. For example, if you pay off the mortgage within the first year, then you owe 2% of the outstanding balance; the penalty fee drops to 1% of the balance if you pay off the loan within the first two years.</li></ul><h2>Prepayment penalty example</h2><p>Prepayment penalties sound complicated, but they’re actually pretty straightforward.</p><p>For example, if your loan imposes a soft prepayment penalty, you’d incur the penalty only if you were to refinance within the first three years. That’s because a refinance pays off your original mortgage.</p><p>A hard prepayment penalty works the same way but isn’t limited to refinances. For example, if you were to sell your home within the first three years of purchasing it, the closing agent that handles the fund disbursements would pay off your loan balance from the proceeds of the sale. This would trigger a hard prepayment penalty. The same result would apply if you make extra payments to pay off the loan early.</p><h2>Why lenders charge prepayment penalties</h2><p>You might think all mortgage lenders want their money back ASAP. But when lenders issue mortgage loans, they expect to earn interest over the entire loan term, typically between 15 and 30 years. When borrowers pay back their mortgages before the term ends, they lose out on all of that interest.</p><p>Prepayment penalties help lenders because they discourage borrowers from paying off their mortgages quickly. They also help lenders recoup some of the money they would have received through interest.</p><h2>How to avoid prepayment penalties</h2><p>The best way to avoid prepayment penalties is to take out a loan that doesn’t carry any. Lenders can’t charge these fees on:</p><ul><li>Single-family <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-an-fha-loan\">FHA loans</a></li><li>VA loans</li><li>USDA loans</li><li>Any <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/adjustable-rate-mortgage\">adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</a></li><li>Any mortgage with a high interest rate</li></ul><p>They can also choose not to charge this fee on conventional loans, so it makes sense to take out a loan from a lender that doesn’t impose the penalty.</p><p>Another way to avoid prepayment penalties is by holding off on refinancing or selling your home until the prepayment penalty period — usually three years — has passed. Or, if your loan’s penalty is a percentage of the principal balance, you can reduce the penalty by paying down the principal balance up to whatever amount the loan allows.</p><h3>Check for a prepayment penalty</h3><p>When you apply for a mortgage, the lender must give you a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/loan-estimate-closing-disclosure\">loan estimate</a> within three days. This standardized document includes details about the loan, including the costs involved and whether any loan terms can change.</p><p>When you get the loan estimate, look at page 1 under the section “Loan Terms” / “Prepayment Penalty.” In the space under the question “Does the loan have this feature?” the document will say “yes” or “no.” If it says “yes,” then your loan has a prepayment penalty.</p><p>The loan estimate will also specify the amount of the penalty and when it may apply.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15334":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15334","content":"<p><img src=\"https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/Loan_estimate_prepayment_penalty_fc264910a3.webp\" alt=\"Loan-estimate-prepayment-penalty.webp\" srcset=\"https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/thumbnail_Loan_estimate_prepayment_penalty_fc264910a3.png 245w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/small_Loan_estimate_prepayment_penalty_fc264910a3.png 500w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/medium_Loan_estimate_prepayment_penalty_fc264910a3.png 750w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/large_Loan_estimate_prepayment_penalty_fc264910a3.png 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\"></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15338","content":"<p>That’s why it’s important to compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best terms for a loan.</p>"},"strapiPartnerComponentBlocksIcbMortgageWidgets:966":{"__typename":"strapiPartnerComponentBlocksIcbMortgageWidgets","id":"966","loanTerm":"PERIOD_FIXED_30YEARS","loanPurpose":"PURCH"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:15342":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"15342","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/author/daria-uhlig\"><i>Daria Uhlig</i></a><i> contributed to the reporting for this article.</i></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267242":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267242","content":"<p>On Apr. 21, 2025, the Department of Education announced that it would resume student loan collection activity, which had been paused after the COVID-19 pandemic.

It uses a combination of factors in its calculation, including repayment history, amounts owed, and credit mix.</p><p>Each student loan you've taken out is tracked as a “tradeline,” or activity record, on your credit report. Positive loan activity, like making full and timely payments, affects 35% of your FICO credit score calculation. Unfortunately, that means that missing payments or defaulting on your loan has a sizable impact on your credit, too.</p><p>“One of the biggest mistakes borrowers make when addressing student loan-related credit damage is not considering the future,” says Tedis Baboumian, chief credit officer of Dovly AI, an app that helps borrowers fix and build their credit scores.</p><p>“Many borrowers enter these student loan agreements when they are young, naive, and uninformed. So when the future arrives and payments get tough, it's tempting to stop opening mail or answering calls from your loan servicer,” he continues. “But ignoring it can make things worse, and potentially lead to a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-default\">default</a>, which would be a major hit to your credit.”</p><p>Missed payments, defaults, bankruptcies, and collections are all considered “derogatory” marks on your credit report. Tradelines with this type of data suggest that you didn't repay your debt according to your loan agreement terms. Adverse payment activity has long-lasting credit effects and can stay on your credit report for up to seven years.</p><p>The same TransUnion analysis revealed that between October 2024 and February 2025, borrowers who were in student loan default saw their credit scores drop by 63 points on average. Depending on where your credit score stood before a default, this decline could be significant enough to knock your score down a rating (e.g., from “good” to “fair”).</p><h2>Can student loan credit damage be repaired?</h2><p>Whether you're hoping to prevent student loan credit damage, are at risk of it, or have loans that are in default, know that there are ways to get back on track.</p><p>“It's important that consumers don't become so overwhelmed with guilt that they bury their heads in the sand when financial hardship arises,” says Leslie H. Tayne, a debt resolution attorney at Tayne Law Group.</p><p>“Financial troubles strike a larger percentage of the population than they may think, so they should know they are not alone, and this is why there are options for consumers facing hardship,” she notes.</p><p>Some options offer almost immediate improvement, like reviewing your credit report and disputing any reporting errors. If you spot an error, reach out to the credit bureaus in writing, over the phone, or by submitting an online dispute. Alongside your dispute letter, include supporting documentation that can prove it's an error.</p><p>For example, if a student loan tradeline says you were late on payments, but during that period, your loan was in forbearance, provide documentation that shows the starting date of the forbearance.</p><p>Other options for credit repair after late student loan payments involve a longer timeline. Borrowers with defaulted federal student loans can request loan rehabilitation. You must agree to certain repayment conditions; in exchange, the default status is removed from your credit report, and you'll regain access to federal aid and benefits like deferment and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">forgiveness</a>.</p><p>“It's also important that the consumer responsibly manages any other debt sums during this time by making on-time, consistent payments, with the goal of paying the balances off every 30 days before interest accrues,” says Tayne. “This will help uplift their credit score when dealing with student loan payment issues.”</p><h2>What are the best strategies for student loan credit repair?</h2><p>Borrowers who are experiencing student loan default<i>, </i><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-collections\">student loan collections</a>, and credit damage can reach out to their federal loan servicer to learn more about their specific options. Here are some ways to manage student loans after adverse credit activity:</p><ul><li><strong>Rehabilitating federal loans:</strong> Loan rehabilitation offers many advantages, like erasing a loan default from your credit record. It also reinstates your eligibility for different repayment plans, loan forgiveness, deferment, forbearance, and even new federal student aid.</li><li><strong>Consolidating federal defaulted loans:</strong> Repairing credit after student loan default with a federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/direct-consolidation-loan\">Direct Consolidation Loan</a> offers many of the same benefits as rehabilitation. The biggest difference is that <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/consolidation-prevent-default\">consolidating defaulted loans</a> doesn't expunge a default status from your credit report. In addition, capitalized interest and collection costs are added to your loan principal when you consolidate.</li><li><strong>Getting back on a repayment plan:</strong> Once your loans are back in good standing, exploring a new repayment plan, like income-driven repayment (IDR), might help make your payments manageable while you rebuild your credit. Enrolling in an IDR plan can also help you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hardship-student-loan-forgiveness\">access student loan forgiveness</a>.</li><li><strong>Making consistent on-time payments: </strong>Staying on top of your monthly payments will help with credit repair after making late student loan payments or entering default.</li><li><strong>Paying down other types of debt: </strong>Your student loans are just one account that makes up your total credit profile. Repaying other types of consumer debt, like credit cards and car loans, on time and keeping unpaid balances low accounts for 30% of your FICO score calculation.</li></ul><h2>How does student loan rehabilitation work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-rehabilitation-vs-consolidation\">Student loan rehabilitation</a> can go a long way in repairing your credit after a student loan default. Depending on the type of federal student loan that's in default, the process can take nine to 10 months to complete.</p><p>Under a written agreement, your loan servicer will calculate a reasonable monthly payment that's either 10% or 15% of your annual discretionary income, and divide that number by 12. You must make full monthly payments within 20 days of the due date.</p><p>For Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program loans, nine payments are required within 10 consecutive months; for federal Perkins Loans, it's nine payments within nine consecutive months.</p><p>After meeting the payment requirements, the default status is removed from your credit report. However, your credit history will continue to show the late payments that were reported before the loan went into default.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267254":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267254","content":"<h2>Can refinancing help improve your credit?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Student loan refinancing</a> is another repayment strategy that simplifies repayment and might help improve your credit.

To qualify for these loans, you must attend an accredited cosmetology school at least half-time.</p><p>Accredited schools must maintain a level of educational standards as recognized by accrediting agencies approved by the U.S. Department of Education. Many esthetician and cosmetology schools have this accreditation, including well-known programs like Aveda and Paul Mitchell. You can determine if your school is accredited using the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/colleges\">School Search tool</a> on the Department of Education's website.</p><p>Even if your school isn't accredited or you're attending school less than half-time, you may still be able to take out <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> to help pay for the program. Just remember that private student loans typically have <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-high-interest-rate\">higher interest rates</a> than federal loans, and they don't offer the same <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">borrower protections</a> as federal student loans.</p><h2>Federal student loans for esthetician school</h2><p>To access federal student loans for esthetician school, you must fill out the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>. Completing the FAFSA is how you apply for federal student loans, in addition to other federal financial aid.</p><p>Gregory Mathews, financial aid administrator at The Institute of Beauty and Wellness (IBW) in Wisconsin, says that most students attending his program fill out the FAFSA to apply for federal student loans.</p><p>“Students at IBW typically qualify for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">subsidized or unsubsidized</a> federal Direct Loans,” explains Mathews. “But parents of our students may also take out PLUS loans to help with expenses.”</p><p>Each of these federal student loan types has different eligibility requirements and terms. Understanding how each federal student loan works can help you make the best borrowing decisions for your needs.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\"><strong>Direct Subsidized Loans</strong></a> are for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. If you qualify for a subsidized loan, you won't have to pay interest while you're enrolled in school at least half-time, during the 6-month grace period after leaving school, or during any periods of deferment.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\"><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loans</strong></a> are available to all students, regardless of their financial need. But interest on unsubsidized loans begins accruing as of the disbursement date, and you're responsible for this interest during all periods.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/parent-plus-loans\"><strong>Parent PLUS loans</strong></a> allow parents of dependent students to borrow money to help pay for their child's undergraduate education. These loans are taken out in parents' names, not students'. Interest on PLUS loans begins accruing as of the disbursement date.</li></ul><h2>Best private student loans for esthetician programs</h2><p>Private student loans may be an option to help you pay for esthetician school.

You can get traditional financing through the motorcycle dealership or even through the manufacturer, but you can also apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> with an online lender, bank, or credit union to finance your ride.</p><p>Financing through the dealership or manufacturer might require a down payment, and a personal loan might carry an origination fee. The former typically means the motorcycle serves as collateral (a <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>), while personal loans don’t require you to use the bike as collateral. Otherwise, these two types of loans work pretty similarly:</p><ul><li>You apply for financing and, if approved, use the funds to pay for the motorcycle.</li><li>You make monthly payments (<a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>) over a set number of years until the loan is paid off.</li><li>Each payment consists of a principal balance (the amount you borrow) plus interest. Note that if the lender charges fees upfront (like an origination fee) and wraps them into the loan, you'd be paying that off too.</li></ul><h3>Is taking out a motorcycle loan a good idea?</h3><p>Taking out a motorcycle loan&nbsp;could be a good idea in the right circumstances. If you intend to use the motorcycle as your primary means of transportation, a motorcycle loan makes a lot of sense. It is likely going to be less than a car payment (the average cost of a new car is nearly $50,000), and motorcycles are also cheaper to fuel and typically cheaper to insure.</p><p>However, if the motorcycle is a luxury purchase — a hobby, and not your primary means of transportation — it’s better to save up and pay cash. We recommend only financing a motorcycle as a luxury purchase if you:</p><ul><li>Have an established <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a></li><li>Have paid down other major debts (especially high-interest credit cards)</li><li>Have disposable income each month</li></ul><h2>Ways to finance your motorcycle</h2><p>You can get a personal loan to finance your motorcycle from an online lender, but banks and credit unions are also viable options. Alternatively, the dealership may offer financing, or you can look for financing through the motorcycle manufacturer itself.</p><h3>Online personal loan lenders</h3><p>An <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lender</a> is a great place to look for a personal loan, and as long as you have fair or better credit and steady income, you should be able to qualify for an unsecured loan to cover the cost. (<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Personal loan requirements</a> vary by lender.)</p><p>Most online lenders offer same- or next-day funding once you’re approved, and because these lenders have low overhead, they often have very competitive interest rates. The&nbsp;best personal loans have rates as low as 6.49%, but rates can go as high as 35.99%. Right now,&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">average personal loan rates</a> are hovering around 14% to 20%, depending on your loan term and credit score.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:246338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"246338","content":"<p>You can usually get a personal loan for anywhere from $2,000 to $50,000, which should be enough to cover the cost of a motorcycle, even a luxury model.

Here's a breakdown of what you may need to pay at closing:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:17766":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"17766","content":"<h2>What factors influence the cost of refinancing?</h2><p>After applying for the refinance, your mortgage lender will give you a loan estimate that includes a list of closing costs, your interest rate and monthly payment, and other details about the loan. Some of the factors that influence your total cost of borrowing include:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan size:</strong> Generally, a larger loan balance carries a larger monthly mortgage payment and higher closing costs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Location: </strong>Where you live can have a big impact on your closing costs when you refinance. Property taxes, appraisal costs, and other closing expenses are all priced differently across the U.S.</li><li><strong>Discount points: </strong>You can choose to pay the lender a fee in exchange for a lower interest rate. The cost of each point amounts to 1% of the mortgage loan balance.</li><li><strong>Type of refinance: </strong>Generally, cash-out refinances come with higher interest rates compared to rate-and-term refinances because they carry more risk for the lender. You might also incur private mortgage insurance if your home equity decreases.</li><li><strong>Fees: </strong>Closing costs may include an application fee, appraisal fee, and title fee. Some lenders may waive or lower these fees, but they’ll also vary with every transaction and in each region.</li></ul><h2>Can I avoid closing costs when refinancing?</h2><p>Yes, it's possible to avoid closing costs when refinancing. This is usually done through a “no-closing-cost” refinance, where the lender pays the closing costs on your behalf.</p><p>But “check the terms closely,” says Nicole Rueth, a branch manager and senior vice president at Movement Mortgage. “Some lenders are eating the costs, but others are passing it along in higher <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-shop-for-mortgage-rates\">interest rates</a>, meaning it will cost you more in the long run.”&nbsp;</p><p>In another scenario, lenders may charge you for some of these fees, even when they call it a no-closing-cost refinance. For instance, you might pay third-party fees like the appraisal or title search costs. To avoid surprises at closing, “compare the offer with other lenders,” Rueth says. “This helps ensure you’re truly getting the best deal.”</p><h2>What is the break-even point for a refinance?</h2><p>The break-even point is when you recoup all of your refinance costs through your monthly savings. You start saving money beyond this point.</p><p>To calculate the break-even point, add up your total refinance costs and divide the sum by the amount you save each month. For instance, if you paid $5,000 to refinance and your new monthly payment is $200 lower than your original payment, then it will take 25 months to break even. Here's how you'd do the math:</p><p>$5,000 / $200 = 25</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:200818":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"200818","content":"<h2>When is refinancing worth the cost?</h2><p>Some experts say refinancing is worth the cost when you can lower your interest rate, but that rule might not work for everyone. According to data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, about <a href=\"https://www.fhfa.gov/data/dashboard/nmdb-outstanding-residential-mortgage-statistics\">15.8% of outstanding mortgages</a> have an interest rate that is 6% or higher; in contrast, Freddie Mac reported the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was just under 7%. Instead, think about what you'd like to achieve by taking out a new home loan.&nbsp;</p><p>“Refinancing is worth the cost when it helps you meet your financial goals,” Hendrix says. “If you can lower your interest rate, reduce your monthly payment, or pay off your loan sooner, refinancing can be a smart move.”</p><p>You may be eligible for lower interest rates if your financial situation has improved since you took out the initial loan, such as from an increase in your credit score or income. Or, if you initially financed your home purchase with an FHA loan, you could refinance into a conventional mortgage and avoid paying mortgage insurance premiums or other required costs.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222254":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222254","content":"<p>Paying off $50,000 in student loan debt isn't easy, but it's possible with the right strategy and mindset.

If you have multiple loans, you can use either the debt avalanche or the debt snowball method to pay them off faster.</p><p>The debt avalanche method focuses on paying off the loan with the highest interest rate first. You make the minimum payments on all your loans and dedicate the rest of your funds to your highest-interest debt. Repeat this process with your other loans until they're all paid off.</p><p>The debt snowball method focuses on paying off your loans from the smallest to the largest, regardless of the interest rate. You make the minimum payments on all your loans and devote the rest of your available money to the smallest balance debt.</p><p>There are advantages and disadvantages to the debt snowball vs. avalanche methods. The debt avalanche method can help you save on interest, but it can take longer for you to see any progress. The debt snowball method allows you to get quicker wins, but it could cost you more over the life of the loan.</p><p>Bevins also recommends trying to make additional payments toward the principal wherever possible. “Many clients choose to apply their annual bonuses toward paying down loan balances instead of spending on a trip or a new car,” he explains.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:6862":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"6862","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"compare-rates"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222270":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222270","content":"<h2>Budgeting tips for managing student loan repayment</h2><p>Managing your monthly student loan payments starts by setting a realistic budget. DeLonde recommends implementing the 50/30/20 rule — 50% of your budget is allocated toward your needs, 30% toward discretionary spending, and 20% toward debt and savings. “Automating your student loan payments can help you avoid missing deadlines,” he advises.</p><p>“When I work with clients who have student loan debt, I return to the fundamentals,” Bevins says. “We review their annual budgets and identify opportunities to reduce expenses. The extra funds we generate each month are allocated toward paying down student loans.”</p><h2>Refinancing student loans to save money</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Refinancing</a> can be a great way to save money on your student loans if you can get a lower interest rate than what you currently have. You can potentially save money on interest over the life of the loan and may even be able to reduce your monthly payments. It also simplifies repayment — if you have multiple student loans, you can consolidate them into a single loan with one monthly payment.</p><p>However, you'll need a good-to-excellent credit score to qualify for the best rates and terms on your refinancing loan.

As a result, if you’re approved for a loan with bad credit, you’re likely to be offered an annual percentage rate (<a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>) over 30%.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are bad credit loans and how do they work?</h2><p>A bad credit loan is any loan that you can potentially qualify for with bad credit. In this article, we focus on bad credit personal loans, which are a type of long-term installment loan. But many bad credit loans are short-term, high-fee loans that don’t require a credit check. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:</p><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><strong>Personal loans for bad credit</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These loans have APRs that top out at 36%; average rates for borrowers with bad credit are around 32% APR, but depend on the loan term you choose, your specific score, your income, current debt, and loan purpose. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">Loan amounts</a> range from around $1,000 to $50,000, with repayment terms typically between 2 and 7 years. They often require a credit check and report to one or more of the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> PALs are available from federal credit unions; loan amounts are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms of up to 1 year. APRs are capped at 28%, making them an excellent option if you need a $2,000 loan or less and are (or can become) a member of a participating credit union. Many credit unions will not check your credit for a PAL.</li><li><strong>Small bank loans:</strong> Some banks, like Bank of America and <a href=\"/personal-loan/us-bank-personal-loans-review\">U.S. Bank</a>, offer small loans up to $500 or $1,000 to existing customers. These may have a short repayment period, such as 3 months, during which you’d pay the loan back in equal installments. Fees tend to be relatively low, and a credit check may not be required.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Use with caution</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Cash apps review your banking history to assess how much you’re eligible to borrow, though loan amounts are usually well under $1,000. Repayment is typically deducted from your checking account on your next payday. Though they may have no mandatory fees, cash advance apps tend to charge same-day funding fees and “optional” tips. Both can lead to triple-digit APRs — 367%, on average, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\"><strong>401(k) loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If your plan allows them, you may be able to borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Repayment terms are 5 years. There’s no credit check (it’s your money), and the interest you pay is low and goes into your account. However, you could lose out on years of market gains. And if you leave your job before the loan is paid back, it becomes due, in full, immediately. If you can’t pay it back, it’s treated as a distribution subject to income tax and an early withdrawal penalty.</li></ul><h3>Avoid</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Payday loans often get a bad rap — and for good reason. The typical payday loan has an APR of almost 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Like cash advance apps, this is due to the combination of high fees, small loan amounts, and very short repayment terms.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\"><strong>Title loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A title loan is a secured loan where your vehicle's title is collateral. You can typically borrow a percentage of your car’s value, but if you fail to repay the loan, the lender can repossess your car. These loans often have very high interest rates and fees, making them a risky borrowing option.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\"><strong>Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A pawnshop loan is a short-term, secured loan where you borrow money by offering a valuable item as collateral. The pawnshop holds your item until you repay the loan with interest and fees — the amount of which could make the cost of borrowing equivalent to a triple-digit APR. If you fail to repay the loan, the pawnshop keeps the item and can sell it. The loan amount is typically a fraction of the item's value.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/what-is-a-bad-credit-personal-loan\">What Is a Bad Credit Loan?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289814":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289814","content":"<h2>How does credit affect your personal loan rate?</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">Your credit score</a> plays a major role in determining the APR you qualify for when you apply for a personal loan.

Five or 10 points either way could mean the difference between qualifying and not qualifying.</li><li><strong>Find lenders with low credit score requirements:</strong> The first and most important step is to find lenders that offer loans to borrowers with a 550 credit score. You can often find minimum credit score requirements on the lender's websites in their FAQ. You can also use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-credible-personal-loan\">personal loan marketplace</a> (like Credible) to compare minimum credit score requirements.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Prequalify</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Next, try to prequalify with multiple lenders to get a sense of which might approve your loan. Prequalification also estimates your rate, upfront fees, and how much you might be approved to borrow. Just note it’s not an offer of credit and the rates and terms of a loan offer may differ from prequalified quotes.</li><li><strong>Compare quotes:</strong> If you were able to prequalify (meaning, one or more lenders provided you with loan quotes), compare them to see which looks best. Consider each quote’s APR, whether an <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is charged and how much, the loan amount, length of the repayment term, and monthly payment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compare lenders you prequalified with:</strong> Consider customer reviews on sites like Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau, as well as <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">funding times</a> between lenders and whether each charges other fees, like late fees. Make sure the lender reports payments to the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Apply</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you’ve decided a personal loan is the way to go, apply with the lender that provided the best loan quote. Be ready to provide documentation, like pay stubs, to support your income and employment, plus a government ID. At this stage, most lenders perform a hard credit check, which could ding your score by up to 10 points for up to 1 year.</li><li><strong>Review the loan agreement:</strong> If approved, review the loan agreement before signing. Make sure the loan amount, repayment schedule, upfront fees, and APR are as expected.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Await funds:</strong> Once you’ve signed the agreement and other documents, the lender will send funds — either directly to your bank account or to your creditors (often an option if you’re getting a debt consolidation loan).&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/how-to-get-a-bad-credit-loan\">How to Get a Bad Credit Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289838":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289838","content":"<h2>How to improve your credit score</h2><p>One of the best ways to get a loan with bad credit is to improve your credit score. The best way for long-lasting gains is to make your monthly payments on time and keep credit card balances low.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Consistently pay bills on time:</strong> Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, the most of any single factor.

The account would be entered on your <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-report\">credit report</a>, which means their history of positive payments and available credit would be as well. Both can significantly boost your credit score.</li><li><strong>Don’t close credit card accounts:</strong> Closing old credit card accounts with a zero balance may seem like a good idea, but it can drastically increase your credit utilization, which can hurt your credit. <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-credit-utilization\">Credit utilization</a> represents the amount of revolving credit you’re using relative to the amount available to you. Keeping accounts open once you’ve paid off balances can be a good way to keep your credit utilization ratio low and improve your score.</li><li><strong>Avoid hard inquiries:</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard inquiry</a> often occurs when you formally apply for a loan.

The application will request information such as your name, address, and date of birth, alongside some details about your school. If you're applying with a cosigner, you'll need to provide their personal and financial details too.</li><li><strong>If approved, select your loan options:</strong> You should find out in as little as 10 minutes whether you're approved for a Sallie Mae loan. If you are, you'll need to select a loan repayment term that works for you, and choose between a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fixed-or-variable-rate?previewRequestUuid=867a7f13-73fd-40d6-8dee-3f6ae47cbc4b\">fixed or variable interest rate</a>.</li><li><strong>Sign and accept your loan: </strong>To finalize your loan, review all loan documents and sign your loan disclosure.

multiple student loan lenders — and want to consolidate them into one monthly payment, you&#x27;ll need to look into refinancing. This lets you combine the separate loan balances into a new loan with one monthly payment. Refinancing private loans can potentially get you a lower interest rate, too.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you pick a longer term, your monthly payment will be lower, but you&#x27;ll pay more interest over time. Refinancing your student loans can lower interest rates, especially if you have a good credit history or apply with a cosigner. Some private lenders allow cosigners to be released from the loan following a specific amount of on-time payments. A lower interest rate means lower monthly payments and overall loan costs.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You can compare rates from multiple private lenders to be sure you find the best fit for your financial needs.</p></section><div class="styles_basicBox__TOi7t mb-32"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Expert insight:</strong> “Before applying to refinance your student loans, I recommend checking your credit score to see where you stand. Most lenders look for a FICO score of at least 670 to qualify. If your credit needs work, consider applying with a cosigner who has strong credit and steady income, such as a spouse or a parent.”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">— Renee Fleck, Student Loans Editor, Credible</em></p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"> </p></section></div><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

For example, if you were to sell your home within the first three years of purchasing it, the closing agent that handles the fund disbursements would pay off your loan balance from the proceeds of the sale.
