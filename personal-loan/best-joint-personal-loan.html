There are no origination fees or other fees, and loans can be used for a wide range of purposes Funds can be available as soon as the same day you apply, and you could have up to 20 years to repay certain types of loans, including home improvement loans, RV loans, and boat loans.  Unlike most lenders, LightStream does not let you prequalify on its site — but you can prequalify through Credible.

Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.  To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate.

Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate. Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Are you more likely to be accepted for a joint personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>It’s not a certainty, but a joint application could pose less risk for lenders, which means it could be easier to qualify for a loan or get a lower rate. A co-applicant means having the ability to draw on more financial resources — namely your co-applicant’s income — to repay the loan than you would on your own.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do joint personal loans impact the credit scores of both applicants?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>How a loan affects your credit score can depend on a variety of factors in your personal financial history. If you only have credit card debt, taking out installment debt might boost your credit score by diversifying your credit mix.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already carrying a lot of debt, credit scoring models may think you’re overloaded and lower your credit score. Regardless, you’re likely to see a temporary ding to your score when you take out a new loan because of the hard credit inquiry from the lender.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a joint loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Similarly to using a cosigner, a co-borrower with a great credit score may help you qualify for a joint personal loan. However, if both applicants have bad credit, it may be difficult to qualify for joint personal loans with attractive terms.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can an unmarried couple get a joint personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes. Under federal law, lenders aren't allowed to discriminate based on marital status. Lenders may <i>ask</i> about marital status on an application for joint credit, but only using the specific terms married, unmarried, or separated.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are some alternatives to a joint loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Alternatives to a joint personal loan include a joint home equity loan or line of credit, a <a href=\"https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26750745&amp;s1=&amp;tid=f11350ce-e9c5-480d-ae48-9ff166af86f0--utm_source%3Dcredible_blog-utm_campaign%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.credible.com%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fbest-joint-personal-loan-utm_medium%3Dreferral&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fbest-joint-personal-loan&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=credible_blog\">credit card</a>, or a personal loan for a single borrower.</p>"}}]}

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline. How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility. For example, an app may require that you've received a certain amount of direct deposits into your bank account, a history of on-time cash advance payments, or a certain number of consecutive deposits.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319314":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319314","content":"<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</a></p><h3>Funding time</h3><p>Most cash advance apps have two options for funding: free and paid. The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee. Chime only charges $2 for instant delivery, and transfers within 24 hours are free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advances can be helpful if you're in a tight financial spot, they aren't meant to be something you continually rely on to cover your expenses, said Dr. Severine Bryan, founder of financial education and coaching company Sev Talks Money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319326","content":"<p>If you need to borrow money but don't want to use cash advance apps, you have several other options. Most require a credit check, but even with bad credit, you could be eligible.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatives to loan apps include:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319318":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319318","content":"<h3>Personal loans</h3><p>Personal loans typically provide low-interest access to a wide variety of funding amounts and repayment terms. Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live. Because the fees are so high, payday loan borrowers often find themselves taking a new advance to pay back their old advance, which creates a cycle of debt, says Nia Adams, executive director at financial wellness consultancy Perspectives.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319330","content":"<h3>Payday alternative loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loans</a> (or PALs) are small, low-cost loans offered by some federal credit unions. Interest rates are capped at 28% on both types of PALs:</p><ul><li><strong>PAL I:</strong> You can borrow between $200 and $1,000 and repay it in 1 to 6 months.</li><li><strong>PAL II:</strong> You can borrow up to $2,000, with no minimum loan amount, and repay it in 1 to 12 months.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Similar to small bank loans, membership is required to get a payday alternative loan. You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs. If you default, the lender can repossess your vehicle.</p><p>Similar to payday loans, rolling over a title loan can literally mean buying time.

So if you have a 30-year mortgage, you could make additional principal payments monthly to pay off the loan faster — potentially trimming years off your loan and saving thousands of dollars in interest. If you can't afford a higher monthly payment, you could direct cash windfalls, like tax refunds and bonuses, to accomplish the same thing.

Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

Make sure the note you receive from your current lender or loan servicer is on official letterhead or from an actual email address from the company. Then, contact your new loan servicer to confirm your loans are being transferred. Doing your due diligence can help you avoid potential student loan scams.</li><li><strong>Create a new account: </strong>When your student loan is sold to another lender or is transferred, you must create an account with the new loan servicer. Go to the loan servicer's website and follow the instructions to create an online login. Typically, you'll create a username and password that gives you access to your account and student loan information. “When a new loan servicer appears, note the address for sending payment and be sure to create an online account to stay on top of any communications and online bills,” says Cohen.</li><li><strong>Update your payment method: </strong>After creating an account with your new loan servicer, update your payment method so you can make payments. Most loan servicers allow you to pay using your debit card or your checking or savings accounts.</li><li><strong>Review account information: </strong>Once the transfer is complete, review your account information for accuracy. Make sure your balance, interest rates, and repayment plan are the same. The transfer shouldn't interrupt your repayment status. So, if you were in <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> before the transfer, you should still be in deferment. If you were enrolled in an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">income-driven repayment plan</a>, you should still be on an IDR plan. Of course, it's a good idea to double-check.</li><li><strong>Re-enroll in autopay: </strong>If your student loan is sold to another lender or transferred, you likely need to re-enroll in autopay. You gave the previous company consent to withdraw funds from your account. Since it's a new loan servicer, you must consent again. Make sure to re-enroll in autopay and continue to make payments manually until it's in effect. When you sign up for autopay, you may qualify for an interest rate deduction of 0.25 percentage points.</li></ol><h2>Does a loan servicer transfer affect repayment plans?</h2><p>If your student loan is sold to another lender or transferred to another loan servicer, it shouldn't affect your repayment plan. Verify that you're on the same repayment plan as before. If not, contact your new lender or loan servicer right away.</p><p>This is especially important for borrowers on income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. You might be working toward <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</a> or IDR forgiveness — in both cases, your monthly payment count matters and gets you closer to forgiveness.</p><p>If you're dealing with a new loan servicer, make sure you're still on an IDR plan. Contact your new loan servicer about when you'll need to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/recertify-income-student-loans\">recertify your income</a> and family size for the plan. If you'd like to switch repayment plans, your loan servicer can assist you in the process.</p><h2>Can you stop your student loan from being sold?</h2><p>Getting a notice that your student loan has been sold to another lender or transferred to a new loan servicer can be an unwanted change. Unfortunately, you can't do anything about it.</p><p>When you sign your student loan's promissory note, you agree to the loan terms and conditions. The Master Promissory Note, which federal loan borrowers sign, states that their loans may be transferred to another loan servicer.</p><p>If you want more agency to choose your lender and loan servicer, you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">refinance your student loans</a>. This allows you to compare different refinancing lenders and choose the one you want to work with.</p><p>Private student loan refinancing companies may be able to offer you a lower interest rate than you currently have, depending on your credit score and history. You can also change your loan terms.</p><p>While this can put you back in control, refinancing federal loans also makes you ineligible for important federal loan protections and benefits, since refinancing <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans\">pays off your existing student loans</a> with a private loan. Therefore, you won't qualify for student loan forgiveness, income-driven repayment, or other perks.</p><p>If you don't plan to take advantage of federal benefits and you have a solid credit score and income, refinancing may help you reduce <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">interest charges</a> and allow you to work with the lender of your choice.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:5894":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"5894","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324798":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324798","content":"<p>Student loan forgiveness has already erased more than $183 billion in debt for borrowers across the country.

Specifically:</p><ul><li>If you’re a new borrower after July 1, 2026, you’ll only have one income-driven repayment plan option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). You’ll have to choose between RAP and the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have existing student loans and don’t take out any new loans after July 1, 2026, you’ll continue to have access to a selection of IDR plans, including Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR).

You’re eligible for PSLF if:</p><ul><li>You’re employed full-time by a qualifying employer, including a nonprofit or the government, such as federal, state, local, and tribal governments.</li><li>You have Direct Loans or have consolidated other eligible federal loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan.</li><li>You’re repaying your loans under an income-driven plan.</li><li>You make 120 qualifying on-time payments.</li></ul><p>Your employer will need to certify your employment for your loans to be forgiven. Because the available IDR plans are changing soon, you may need to switch to a different repayment plan as you work toward making your 120 qualifying on-time payments.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education also imposed new restrictions on qualifying employment, making clear that you cannot qualify for PSLF if you are working for “organizations that engage in unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose, including supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration.”</p><p>Some critics have argued that the restriction could be applied in a politically influenced manner and unfairly block some organizations from qualifying for forgiveness.</p><h2>Income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness</h2><p>IDR plans are another popular way to qualify for loan forgiveness. These options allow borrowers to set payments at a specific percentage of income, and then any balance that remains at the end of the required repayment period is forgiven.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are three active IDR plans and one plan that has been suspended by the courts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\"><strong>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If you first borrowed after July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years. If you first borrowed before July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 15% of discretionary income, and remaining balances are forgiven after 25 years.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pay as You Earn (PAYE):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and forgiveness is available after 20 years. Payments must be less than the amount due under the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are set at the lesser of 20% of income or the amount you'd pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over the course of 12 years, adjusted based on income. Forgiveness is available after 25 years.&nbsp; This plan is currently the only option parents with PLUS loans can qualify for, but they must consolidate first.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE):</strong>&nbsp;The courts have blocked the SAVE Plan, so borrowers can’t enroll in this plan.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Anyone who borrowed before July 1, 2026, can choose between IBR, PAYE, and ICR, provided they don't take out any new loans. However, PAYE and ICR are going away after July 1, 2028, and borrowers on one of these plans will need to change to IBR before that date or will be put on the new Repayment Assistance Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>The partial financial hardship requirement for the IBR Plan is being eliminated, and parents with loans issued before July 1, 2028, can consolidate to become eligible for IBR as long as the consolidation is completed before the deadline and they enroll in ICR (including making one payment) immediately before enrolling in IBR.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Repayment Assistance Plan is the only IDR plan that will be available to new borrowers after July 1, 2026. Borrowers with older loans can also choose to switch to RAP.</p><p>RAP calculates payments based on adjusted gross income (AGI) instead of discretionary income. Payments on the RAP plan are between 1% and 10% of AGI, but there’s an annual minimum payment of $120. When payments don't fully cover monthly interest, unpaid interest is canceled so your balance doesn't increase. Any remaining balance after 30 years is forgiven.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:16110":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"16110","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324810":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324810","content":"<h2>Profession-based forgiveness programs</h2><p>There are also loan forgiveness programs available for people in certain professions.

If your credit score isn't high enough, you might consider another lender or apply with a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">co-applicant or cosigner</a> who has a good credit score.

That means your monthly debt obligations account for no more than 36% of your pre-tax monthly income.</li><li><strong>Employment and income:</strong> Lenders often require you to prove employment status and/or income. Sources of income can include salary or hourly wages, 1099 income for contractors, and government benefits.</li><li><strong>Age, citizenship, and residency:</strong> Lenders may require that you're a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, or have a valid visa.

Here are some personal loan alternatives to consider:</p><h3>Savings</h3><p>If you have an <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a> — and the situation is an actual emergency rather than an impulsive purchase — tapping into it is the most straightforward way to pay for an unexpected expense. You might deplete your emergency savings, but you wouldn't have to take on debt.</p><h3>Family loan</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/family-loans\">Asking family to borrow money</a> might not be easy, but it could help you out of a tough financial spot. Keep in mind that a $15,000 family loan is above the $10,000 threshold that the IRS uses to demarcate “gift loans.” For loans above $10,000, the lender is generally required to charge interest based on the IRS' schedule of <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-25-05.pdf\">Applicable Federal Rates</a>, and may have to report the interest as income.</p><p>Clarify the arrangement formally by documenting a repayment schedule, timeline, interest rate, and payment amounts. You could do this yourself, but you may prefer to bring in a professional organization specializing in family loans like <a href=\"https://namma.co/\">Namma</a>.</p><h3>Home equity loan or HELOC</h3><p>If you've built up enough equity in your home, you may be able to get a lower interest rate than a personal loan with a <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-home-equity\">home equity loan</a> or <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC). Lenders typically require that you have at least 15% or 20% equity in your home and use your home as collateral for the loan. While a home equity loan can result in low monthly payments, repayment terms can be long — up to 30 years in some cases — which can result in a relatively high loan cost (even with a low interest rate).</p><p>Compare loan terms and costs to other loan types before proceeding. It often takes weeks to close a home equity loan, and costs may be higher than other loan types due to the appraisal process.</p><h3>Credit card</h3><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">credit card</a> with a $15,000 credit limit or higher could be used instead of an installment loan to purchase what you need. Some have an <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">introductory 0% APR</a> on purchases and balance transfers. Zero-APR offers can range from a few months to nearly two years, depending on the issuer — meaning the transferred balance or purchase doesn't accrue interest during the introductory period.</p><p>However, balance transfers often come with a 3% to 5% balance transfer fee. In either case, the trick is to avoid paying interest entirely; you need to pay off the balance on the new card before the offer expires and the regular APR goes into effect.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\">9 Personal Loan Alternatives</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296114":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296114","content":"<p>Having good credit can make it easier to get approved for a personal loan and qualify for a low interest rate.

The APR, terms, and fees in a loan offer might differ from prequalified quotes.&nbsp;</li><li>Prequalification involves a soft credit inquiry that won’t affect your credit score, but applying for a loan typically requires a hard credit inquiry that could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for up to a year.</li></ul><p>Note that some lenders have minimum credit score and income requirements, although they’re not always disclosed.

Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to see how the length of the repayment term affects the size of your monthly payment and interest costs over the life of the loan.

Lenders are required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to display APR when advertising rates, so borrowing costs are generally transparent. However, be sure to check for other fees, such as late fees. Although most lenders don’t charge prepayment penalties for paying off a loan early, it never hurts to check the fine print.</li><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Loan amounts vary between lenders. Make sure the lender offers the loan amount you need. Note that you might qualify for a larger loan amount with a lender that offers longer repayment terms relative to one that doesn’t.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> Look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> offered by lenders you are considering. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less interest overall. Longer terms lower monthly costs but increase the total interest paid.</li><li><strong>Customer service:</strong> Choose a lender with a reputation for providing excellent customer support. You want a lender that will be helpful and responsive if you have questions or issues with your loan.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> are valuable resources for researching how well lenders and other businesses treat their customers.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>Will a personal loan boost my credit score?</h2><p>Yes, a personal loan can increase your credit score over time if managed responsibly. Here are a few key ways that getting a personal loan, and repaying it, can help your score:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining a positive payment history:</strong> Payment history is the largest factor in determining your FICO score (35%). Making each loan payment helps strengthen your record of paying on time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Amount of debt owed:</strong>&nbsp;This category accounts for 30% of your FICO score, making it the second-most influential factor after payment history. Although taking out a personal loan increases your total debt, paying off the loan gradually reduces it. FICO looks at debt owed on all your accounts, so it’s important to fulfill your other obligations in addition to the loan.</li><li><strong>Lowering your credit utilization ratio:</strong> Your credit utilization is the amount you owe on revolving credit lines, such as credit cards, compared to your credit limits. If you use a personal loan to&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">consolidate credit card debt</a>, you could reduce your credit utilization ratio and see improvements to your credit score within one month.</li><li><strong>Diversifying your credit mix:</strong> Lenders like to see that you can handle multiple types of credit. Adding a new personal loan could improve your credit mix, which accounts for 10% of your FICO score, especially if you don't have another type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a> on your credit report.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296158":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296158","content":"<h2>Alternatives to personal loans&nbsp;</h2><p>Although a personal loan can be very useful, it’s not a Swiss army knife.

You can get an unsecured line of credit from some banks, for example. Once you're approved, you can draw from it as needed during the draw period. Lines of credit may have a defined draw period and repayment period or a continuous draw period:</p><ul><li><strong>Draw period:</strong> The time during which you can use the line of credit. Interest-only payments may be required.</li><li><strong>Repayment period:</strong>&nbsp;Once the repayment period begins, you can no longer use the credit line and will pay off the balance in installments over a period of years.</li><li><strong>Continuous draw period:</strong>&nbsp;You can keep using the line of credit, similar to a credit card.</li></ul><p>Lines of credit typically have variable interest rates. How large a credit line you qualify for will depend on your credit, income, and current debt.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>Some banks and lenders offer a specific product called a home equity line of credit (HELOC) that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. Lenders typically require that you have at least 20% available equity to qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>A HELOC may have a lower variable APR and higher credit line available and may offer longer repayment terms than other lines of credit. How large a credit line you qualify for will depend on the amount of equity you have in your home, your credit, income, and current debt.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296162":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296162","content":"<h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>Like a HELOC, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> lets you tap your home's equity, and the home is used as collateral.

The average credit card interest rate is over 21%, according to the Federal Reserve, and interest on any unpaid balance can add up quickly. However, there are a few instances when using a credit card could be a better option:</p><ol><li><strong>You can qualify for a 0% APR promotion:</strong> If you have good credit, you might be eligible for a&nbsp;card with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR</a> on new purchases and balance transfers. Keep in mind that transfers often come with a fee from 3% to 5%. Zero APR offers may last from 6 to 21 months or more. If you can pay off the balance within that time, you can essentially get an interest-free loan. However, the card’s regular APR applies after the promotional period ends.</li><li><strong>You can pay off the balance within the card's grace period:</strong> Credit cards typically have a grace period of one billing cycle, during which time you won't be charged interest on purchases. If you can't pay your balance within the grace period, the purchase will be charged interest at the card's standard APR.</li><li><strong>You plan to refinance credit card debt:</strong> If you're eligible for a 0% APR promotion but can't pay off the balance within the promotional period, you might consider using a personal loan to refinance the debt before the APR adjusts. This is not necessarily recommended since there's no guarantee you'll be able to qualify for debt consolidation.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:296166":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"296166","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated <strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best loans for good credit.

A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">mortgage affordability calculator</a> can help you set a budget.</li><li><strong>Do a credit check: </strong>Your credit history and credit score will play a major part in your loan application, so request a copy of your credit report and review it ahead of time. If you have late payments, collection efforts, or other negative events on your report, address those before you apply, as they could hurt your chances. Plus, if there are any fraudulent accounts or errors in your report, you can dispute them with the reporting credit bureau.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved:</strong> It helps to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">get pre-approved for a mortgage</a> before searching for a home. When you apply for pre-approval, the lender reviews your credit history and borrower profile and gives you a letter describing the loan terms and amounts you’re likely to be approved for later. A pre-approval letter can give you a good price range to shop in and give sellers more confidence when you make offers.</li><li><strong>Compare rates and mortgage offers:</strong> Next, you’ll want to compare options.

You will also need to agree to a credit check.</li><li><strong>Await approval: </strong>Your loan will then go into <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">underwriting</a>, which is when your lender verifies your income, savings, and other assets and makes sure you can repay the loan. The lender will also order an appraisal to gauge the home’s value (and make sure it’s worth the money you’re requesting to borrow for it).</li><li><strong>Get ready for closing: </strong>Once your loan is nearing full approval, you’ll get a closing date, which is when you’ll sign the final paperwork and receive your keys. You’ll typically need proof of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/home-insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need\">homeowners insurance</a> by this day, so be sure to shop around for your policy early.</li><li><strong>Close on your loan: </strong>When closing day rolls around, you’ll attend your appointment and sign the required paperwork.

Since they're installment loans, they impact your overall credit mix, which accounts for 10% of your FICO score. Having a variety of types of debt can improve your score.</p><p>However, student loan payments are included in your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, which is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward debt payments. High student debt can increase your DTI ratio, which can affect your ability to get a mortgage or take out other loans.</p><h2>On-time payments help your credit score</h2><p>One of the biggest ways student loans impact your credit score is through your payment history. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, so it's the biggest factor in determining your credit score.</p><p>That means there's an opportunity to improve your credit score through consistent, on-time student loan payments. Establishing a history of on-time payments shows lenders you're reliable and can help you qualify for better rates and terms on future loans. As you continue to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans\">pay off student loans</a>, you'll lower your overall debt, boosting your credit score.</p><h2>Missed or late payments hurt your credit score</h2><p>Missed or late student loan payments can hurt your credit score in several ways. A late payment will typically show up on your credit report once it's 30 days past due for private student loans and 90 days for federal student loans. Just one late payment can cause your credit score to drop by 100 points or more, so the impact is significant.</p><p>Late payments usually stay on your credit report for up to seven years, though the impact will lessen as time goes by.</p><p>If you are 270 days past due on your federal student loan payments or 120 days past due on private student loans, your loan is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/defaulting-on-student-loans\">considered in default</a>. Defaulting on your loans not only hurts your credit score but can also lead to wage garnishment and having your tax refunds withheld.

If your student loans were your only installment, paying them off early can lower your credit mix. Once the closed account is removed from your credit report, it can reduce your average account age, which makes up 15% of your credit score.</p><p>“However, this minor dip does not outweigh the long-term benefits of reducing debt and improving cash flow,” says Bevins.</p><p>Kayikchyan agrees, adding, “Despite these short-term effects, becoming debt-free is a substantial financial move that will improve your financial stability in the long run, giving you a sense of reassurance and confidence in your financial future.”</p><h2>Tips to improve your credit score</h2><p>Effectively managing your student loans is the best way to improve your credit score and achieve long-term financial stability. Here are some strategies you can implement:</p><ul><li><strong>Set up autopay: </strong>When you sign up for autopay, your student loan payments will be automatically taken out of your bank account each month, so you never miss a payment. In many cases, your loan servicer will also reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percentage points for signing up for autopay.</li><li><strong>Keep old loans on your credit report: </strong>Once you pay off a loan, don't request to have it removed from your credit report immediately, since this can negatively impact your credit score. Paid off loans can remain on your credit report for up to 10 years, which will positively impact your credit score.</li><li><strong>Consider refinancing: </strong>Refinancing your student loans can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-interest-rate\">lower your interest rate</a> and help you pay off your debt faster, which will benefit your credit score in the long run. However, be careful about refinancing federal student loans because you'll lose out on federal benefits like income-driven repayment and potential loan forgiveness.</li></ul>"},"strapiBlogStandaloneArticlePageType:14":{"__typename":"strapiBlogStandaloneArticlePageType","id":"14","slug":"lending-partners","title":"Our Lending Partners","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:13:34.773Z","publishedAt":"2024-12-02T13:47:52.703Z","blocks":[{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","content":"<h1>Our Lending Partners</h1><h2>Student Loan Refinancing</h2><ul><li>Brazos</li><li>Citizens</li><li>Earnest</li><li>EDvestinU</li><li>ELFI</li><li>INvestEd</li><li>Lendkey</li><li>MEFA</li><li>RISLA</li><li>SoFi</li></ul><h2>Private Student Loans</h2><ul><li>Abe</li><li>Ascent</li><li>Citizens</li><li>College Ave</li><li>Custom Choice</li><li>ELFI</li><li>INvestEd</li><li>MEFA</li><li>Nelnet Bank</li><li>Sallie Mae</li><li>SoFi</li></ul><h2>Personal Loans</h2><ul><li>Avant</li><li>Axos</li><li>Best Egg</li><li>BHG Money</li><li>Citibank</li><li>Happy Money</li><li>LendingClub Bank and its Service Providers</li><li>LendingPoint</li><li>LightStream</li><li>OneMain Financial</li><li>Prosper</li><li>Reach Financial</li><li>Reprise Financial</li><li>Rocket Loans</li><li>SoFi</li><li>Splash</li><li>Universal Credit</li><li>Upgrade</li><li>Upstart</li></ul><h3>Alternative Providers</h3><ul><li>Beyond Finance LLC, d/b/a Accredited Debt Relief</li><li>CreditFresh</li><li>National Debt Relief LLC, d/b/a National Debt Relief</li><li>Forbes Digital Marketing Inc. d/b/a Forbes Advisor</li><li>JGW Debt Settlement LLC d/b/a JG Wentworth</li><li>OppLoans</li><li>NetCredit</li><li>Yrefy</li></ul><h2>Extended Network*</h2><p><strong>AmONE</strong></p><p>Credible keeps this list up to date, but it may not reflect all of the partners our Network Partner works with due to recent updates.

If you need a loan larger than $50,000, Alliant is one of two lenders on this list to offer that. Like PenFed, you can also apply for a loan as a non-member.</p><p>There are several pathways to becoming an Alliant member.

Credit union personal loans may have lower rates than loans offered by banks or online lenders, especially if you have good credit. They also tend to offer lower starting loan amounts, making them a good choice for small personal loans. However, you generally will need to be or become a member of the credit union to qualify for a personal loan.&nbsp;</p><p>One potential drawback to credit union loans relative to personal loans from banks and online lenders is that they may not offer a prequalification process. Prequalification can give you an idea of whether you'll qualify for a personal loan and what rate you might get without hurting your credit. This is important since most lenders run a hard credit check when you apply for a loan, which can bring your score down by up to 10 points for up to one year.</p><p>Also keep in mind that not all credit unions are the same. Federal credit unions are run by the federal government, while state-chartered credit unions are run by financial regulatory agencies in their respective states. State-chartered credit unions may have more flexible lending options and membership eligibility. All federal credit unions are federally insured, while state-chartered credit unions have the option of federal or private insurance.</p><h3>Payday alternative loans</h3><p>Payday alternative loans (PALs) are offered exclusively by federal credit unions and work similarly to personal loans, but are not the same. They’re designed for people who might struggle to be approved for a regular personal loan due to bad credit. As such, they have higher rates than personal loans from credit unions, plus smaller loan amounts and shorter repayment terms.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> Up to 12 months</li><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Up to $2,000</li><li><strong>APR:</strong> Maximum 28%</li><li><strong>Credit check:</strong> Typically no</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:300054":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"300054","content":"<h2>Average credit union personal loan rates</h2><p>As of September 2025, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncua.gov/analysis/cuso-economic-data/credit-union-bank-rates/credit-union-and-bank-rates-2025-q2\">average interest rate</a> for a 36-month unsecured personal loan from a credit union was 10.72%, compared to 12.06% from a bank.</p><p>Credit union personal loans typically also have lower maximum interest rates than banks since they're limited by the NCUA's 18% rate cap.

They also tend to have lower interest rates and fewer fees than online lenders, especially if you don’t have good credit.

According to Stan Reinford, a mortgage loan originator with Movement Mortgage, lenders typically request the letters for very simple reasons.</p><h2>Why might a lender request a letter of explanation?</h2><p>To understand why your lender might ask for a letter of explanation, it’s useful to understand how loan underwriting works.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">Underwriting</a> is the lender’s process for evaluating your income, expenses, and credit to make sure you are able to, and are likely to, repay your loan. As part of that process, the lender does a deep dive into every aspect of your finances, including your employment history, your banking history, investment accounts, and your credit history, in addition to your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/credit-score-for-home-loan\">credit score</a>. The process is very thorough, so it’s not unusual for some aspect of a borrower’s finances to raise questions or need some context.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s where the letter of explanation comes in. The purpose of the letter is to show that you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-qualifications\">qualify for your mortgage loan</a>.</p><h2>Common scenarios requiring a letter of explanation</h2><p>Reinford says lenders request letters of explanation for many different reasons, such as:</p><ul><li>The address on the mortgage application doesn’t match the address on the credit report, driver's license, pay stub, bank account, or other document</li><li>Bank statements show overdrafts</li><li>Bank statements show an “unsourced” deposit that doesn’t come from payroll or a transfer from another, documented account, which could raise concerns that the borrower received <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-for-down-payment\">loan money</a> without reporting it as such</li><li>Gaps in employment</li><li>Credit issues such as collections, charge-offs, or bankruptcy</li><li>Recently opened credit accounts</li><li>Relocation to a new area that will extend the borrower’s work commute</li></ul><p>The lender might ask for another type of explanation letter, called a “full use of funds” letter, if the borrower has a joint bank account with someone who is not listed on the mortgage application. In this case, “The person(s) would be required to write a letter that states they have full use and access to the monies for the purchase,” Reinford says.</p><h2>How to write an effective letter of explanation</h2><p>When it comes to writing a letter of explanation, less is more, Reinford says. If the letter is too long or contains more details than the lender asks for, it could raise more questions.</p><p>“Depending on the circumstance, the lender may ask for supporting documentation,” Reinford says.

The higher the interest rate, the more expensive the loan, in most cases. It’s also crucial to see how much interest you pay on loans with different repayment terms. For instance, a longer-term loan with a lower interest rate could actually cost more to repay than a shorter-term loan with a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>“Taking a few minutes to understand how interest is calculated helps you compare offers more accurately and plan your payments with confidence,” says Sean Briscoe, Director of Products and Payments at Alliant Credit Union. Many lenders express a loan's interest rate as an annual percentage rate, or APR, which accounts for both the interest rate and any upfront fees. Comparing APRs on different loans can make it easier to understand which loan could cost you less overall.&nbsp;</p><h2>Methods of calculating loan interest</h2><p>There are different ways a lender can calculate interest on your loan. Some loans charge simple interest, while others charge compound interest, which may accrue daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. A loan that charges simple interest is generally lower-cost than a loan that charges compound interest at the same rate.&nbsp;</p><p>In the following sections, learn how to calculate loan interest using the simple interest and compound interest methods.&nbsp;</p><h3>Simple interest method</h3><p>Simple interest is calculated on the principal loan balance only. So, even if the amount you owe were to increase because of new interest charges, you wouldn’t be charged interest on the interest you owe.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:302954":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"302954","content":"<h4>Where used&nbsp;</h4><p>Many personal loans have simple interest, as do most auto loans, student loans, and mortgages.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/short-term-loans\">Short-term loans</a>, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-loans-vs-personal-loans\">payday loans</a>, also commonly have simple interest.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:302942":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"302942","content":"<h3>Compound interest method</h3><p>Compound interest is calculated based on the principal amount of your loan&nbsp;and any interest that has been added to your balance. When your loan uses a compound interest calculation, you essentially pay interest on the interest charged, which may cause your balance to grow quickly over time. Interest may even compound daily on some debts, like credit cards.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:302946":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"302946","content":"<h4>Where used</h4><p>You'll see compound interest more with revolving debts, like credit cards, rather than installment loans, like personal loans or auto loans.&nbsp;</p><h2>Simple interest vs. compound interest</h2><p>Based on the examples above for a $5,000 five-year loan at 18%, interest costs by each method would be:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple interest:</strong> $4,500</li><li><strong>Compound interest:</strong> $7,450</li></ul><p>However, in both cases, no principal payments are made on the loan, which would be uncommon for an actual loan. These examples are only to demonstrate the difference between simple and compound interest.</p><h2>What is amortization?</h2><p>Lenders apply complex calculations to spread costs, including principal and interest, over a loan’s repayment term. This process is called amortization, and typically applies to loans that charge simple interest. It allows you to have a fixed monthly payment while paying down part of your balance and loan interest with each payment. Because lenders calculate interest on your remaining balance, interest is highest at the start of the loan, so early payments cover mostly interest instead of principal.&nbsp;</p><p>“That can make it feel like the balance isn't moving much at first, but that's just how amortization works,” says Briscoe. “As time goes on, the portion going toward principal gradually increases, and you start building equity or reducing your debt faster.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:302950":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"302950","content":"<h4>Where used&nbsp;</h4><p>Amortization usually occurs with installment loans that charge simple interest, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-amortization\">mortgages</a> and personal loans. If your loan is amortized, your lender may give you an amortization schedule that breaks down the amount of interest and principal each payment will cover until you pay off the loan.</p><h2>Factors that impact loan interest</h2><p>Several factors can influence the interest rate you get on a loan:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Inflation and the economy:</strong> Outside influences, like inflation and the current economy, affect interest rates. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/federal-reserve-impact-to-personal-loans\">Federal Reserve</a> attempts to counteract inflation by raising interest rates to slow the economy (and bring down inflation) or lowering rates to boost the economy. “For the years between the financial crisis and the pandemic, inflation was very low, and borrowers benefited from very low rates,” explains Robert S. Goldberg, James F. Bender Clinical Professor of Finance at Adelphi University. “Since the pandemic, the government has struggled to control inflation, and this has led to significantly higher borrowing costs for everyone.”</li><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Lenders commonly check a borrower's credit score to get insight into how responsibly they use credit. Borrowers with bad or fair credit may be riskier to a lender, so they'll typically pay a higher interest rate than they would with an excellent credit score. Use Credible's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">free credit-monitoring tool</a> to check your score before applying.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> DTI indicates how much of your income goes toward debt payments. Generally, lenders like to see a DTI below 36%. A low DTI can signal to lenders that you manage debts responsibly, which could lead to a lower rate. On the other hand, a high DTI adds more risk for the lender, potentially warranting a higher interest rate. To calculate DTI, divide your minimum monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan length: </strong>Through the lender's lens, a longer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment term</a> gives more opportunities for a borrower to default. Therefore, a five-year loan term often leads to a higher interest rate than, say, a two-year loan term.</li><li><strong>Loan-to-value ratio (LTV): </strong>LTV measures the amount borrowed against the asset securing the loan, like a home or car. A lower LTV means a borrower is financing less of the purchase price, reducing the lender's risk and potentially offering a lower interest rate. LTV is only applicable for secured loans, like mortgages.</li><li><strong>Secured vs. unsecured:</strong> Different types of loans have different interest rates. For example, a mortgage usually has a much lower rate than a personal loan because it's secured by your home, so the lender has more protection if you default.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Common mistakes when calculating loan interest</h2><p>Aside from using the wrong formula to calculate the type of interest on your loan, there are a few additional factors that could affect how you calculate loan interest if you want to estimate your payments and interest costs:<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Missing small details in the formula:</strong> Interest formulas are often complex, and it can be easy to plug in the wrong number or make an error in the calculation. But even a small error can throw off your interest and payment estimate. Double-checking your work is always a good idea, but it can also help to use an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">online loan calculator</a> that can make the calculations for you based on your loan information.</li><li><strong>Confusing interest rate and APR:</strong> A loan's interest rate is the amount a lender charges to finance your loan. APR includes interest and upfront fees, which can give you a better idea of your actual costs for the loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Calculating the wrong compounding frequency:</strong> Two loans might look the same number-wise, but if one compounds interest more frequently than the other despite having the same interest rate, it'll increase what you pay over time. Before borrowing, read through the loan agreement to determine how the lender calculates interest, or contact the lender for more information.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:210062":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"210062","content":"<p>Capital One doesn't offer <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, but many other reputable lenders do.

If that's the case, consider looking into the following alternatives:</p><h3>Fellowships and assistantships</h3><p>Graduate fellowships and assistantships both provide financial support to graduate students, but they have some key differences.</p><p>A <strong>fellowship</strong> offers a living stipend to graduate students who demonstrate academic excellence, but it's not a form of employment. Instead, graduate schools often use fellowships to incentivize students to complete their program there. You can think of a fellowship as a merit-based award. Fellowships can come from a university, private foundation, or local, state, or federal agency.</p><p><strong>Assistantships</strong>, on the other hand, allow grad students to earn money in exchange for teaching or conducting research. An assistantship can offer a monthly salary and tuition waiver, and may cover institutional fees and health insurance.</p><h3>Employer tuition assistance</h3><p>Many employers offer tuition assistance (paying for courses up front) or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">reimbursement</a> (paying you back for your course costs) to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. If you're working full- or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/part-time-student-loans\">part-time</a> to put yourself through grad school, reach out to your employer to find out if it offers educational assistance. Companies can offer up to $5,250 per employee each year tax-free.</p><h3>Private student loans</h3><p>In situations where federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/graduate-student-loans\">student loans for grad students</a> and other forms of financial aid fall short, it may be worth considering private student loans as a way to bridge the gap.

But only those who enrolled by the deadline had their loans transferred to a new servicer and restored to good standing, with the option to start repayment or apply for forgiveness.</p><h2>How does Fresh Start work?</h2><p>Fresh Start allows you to remove your federal loans from default and restore them to current status. After signing up for Fresh Start online, by phone, or by mail before the Oct. 2, 2024, deadline, your loans are transferred to a new servicer, and the default is erased from your credit report.</p><p>Once the new servicer takes over, your loan gets placed on the Standard Repayment Plan.

These tips can help you avoid defaulting again in the future:</p><ul><li><strong>Sign up for an income-driven repayment plan:</strong> These plans adjust your payments based on your income and family size to help make repayment more affordable.</li><li><strong>Understand your deferment and forbearance options:</strong> If you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/cant-pay-student-loans\">can't make your monthly payments</a>, consider deferment or forbearance as temporary solutions. While income-driven plans are often the better choice, deferment or forbearance can pause payments if you're facing financial hardship. Just remember that interest may continue to accrue, increasing your loan balance.</li><li><strong>Set up automatic payments: </strong>Autopay helps you never miss a payment by automatically withdrawing the amount due from your bank account. Plus, many lenders offer a 0.25 percentage point rate discount when you enroll in autopay.</li><li><strong>Monitor your finances regularly:</strong> Keeping tabs on your budget, including spending and income, can help ensure you have the money you need to pay your student loans.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:323414":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"323414","content":"<p>Income-Based Repayment (IBR) is an income-driven repayment plan available for federal student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>Access to the IBR Plan was broadened in the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” and IBR will be one of only two income-driven repayment options for federal student loans after July 1, 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>IBR caps monthly payments at between 10% and 15% of discretionary income, depending on when you first borrowed.

The lender can take the collateral from you if you fail to repay the money you owe.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">Examples of collateral</a> include the title to your vehicle, the money in a savings account, and the fixtures in your home. If you apply for a secured personal loan, the lender will still check your credit, income, and current debt. But you may have an easier time qualifying for the loan, or may be able to get a lower rate relative to an unsecured loan.</p><h3>Unsecured personal loans</h3><p>Most personal loans are <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\">unsecured loans</a>. That means you don’t need to provide collateral. The lender uses your financial and credit information exclusively to determine the loan amount and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a> (APR) — the interest rate plus any upfront fees — you’re eligible for.</p><p>But if you fail to repay an unsecured personal loan, the lender still has recourse. The lender can’t take your property, but it can begin debt collection efforts, report negative information to the credit bureaus, or file a lawsuit against you.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\">Secured vs. Unsecured Personal Loans</a></p><h3>Cosigned loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-cosigner\">cosigner</a>, or guarantor, is someone who typically has stronger credit and more reliable income and is willing to put their name on a loan alongside yours to improve your chances of getting approved. Cosigning a loan is a big responsibility for your cosigner. If you can’t keep up with your payments, the cosigner must step in and make payments on your behalf, or risk damage to their own credit score and finances.</p><p>Cosigners are common on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>. Parents can cosign for their children, who often haven’t established enough credit history to qualify on their own. Though they’re less common for personal loans, it’s still possible to find some lenders offering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loans with cosigners</a>.</p><p>The borrowing amounts, terms, and fees for cosigned personal loans are consistent with unsecured personal loans. You may get a more competitive interest rate or improve your chances of approval with the help of your cosigner.</p><h3>Joint loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\">joint personal loan</a> differs slightly from a cosigned personal loan. A joint applicant, or co-borrower, has equal access to the funds borrowed. That co-borrower is also equally on the hook for the repayment. Because you’re sharing money and responsibility for repayment, it’s wise to jointly apply for a loan with someone you trust, such as a spouse, parent, sibling, or child.</p><p>If one borrower has a significantly lower credit score or less stable income than the other, the lender may weigh the lower score more heavily. For instance, if a married couple wants a home improvement loan but one spouse has a much lower credit score, it may make more sense for the other spouse to apply alone. Doing so may secure more funding with a better rate and lower fees.</p><p>However, if you have a low income and need to borrow a larger amount, a joint loan with someone who has a higher salary could help get you a higher maximum loan amount. Lenders consider both incomes combined when determining how much you can realistically borrow.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:307858":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"307858","content":"<h2>How to get a personal loan with low income</h2><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Check minimum income requirements</li><li>Check your credit score and credit report</li><li>Know your DTI</li><li>Prequalify</li><li>Compare lenders</li></ul><h3>1. Check minimum income requirements</h3><p>While some personal loan lenders don’t specify their minimum income requirements, most do. In all cases, the lender will check to see if you have enough income to manage the monthly payments on your loan.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to find lenders with a minimum income requirement lower than your annual or monthly income. For many lenders, government benefits such as disability or unemployment count as income. Note that lenders may have other specific requirements for income sources. For example, some lenders may not consider your spouse’s income or other household income.</p><h3>2. Check your credit score and credit report</h3><p>In addition to minimum income requirements, most lenders require a certain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score to qualify for a personal loan</a>. Check your credit score for free with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">Credible's credit-monitoring tool</a>. This way, you can find lenders with low income requirements that also have minimum credit score requirements lower than yours. Note that some lenders may have different credit score requirements if you apply for a loan with them directly, instead of applying through a loan marketplace like Credible.</p><p>Also, check your credit report for free at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> and look for any errors that might be dragging your credit score down. If you find incorrect or outdated information, dispute it with the appropriate credit bureau.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Know your DTI</h3><p>Having sufficient income isn’t always enough. Lenders also consider your credit score and history, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>, which is the percentage of your gross monthly income that you spend on minimum debt payments. If your DTI is higher than 36%, you may have trouble qualifying for a personal loan.</p><h3>4. Prequalify</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> is not an offer of credit. It's more like a lender's estimate of rates you might qualify for. It takes a few minutes to prequalify for a personal loan and, unlike a formal loan application, won’t hurt your credit. If you’re unsure whether you’ll be approved, prequalification is a smart way to get a sense of that without hurting your credit.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you apply for a personal loan, a lender typically conducts a hard credit pull, which could&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">lower your credit score</a> by up to 10 points for up to 1 year.</p><h3>5. Compare lenders</h3><p>Once you’ve prequalified with multiple lenders, compare APRs, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">loan amounts</a>, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">terms</a>. Check lender fees, and whether it charges an <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>. Though the origination fee is reflected in the APR, it is typically deducted upfront from the loan amount. In other words, if you choose a loan with an origination fee, you could receive less money than you applied for while still having to pay the full amount.</p><p>Also check lender reputations and complaints. You can do this on sites like <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a>. Note that most lenders will have complaints, but look for patterns in those complaints that indicate the same problems occurring repeatedly.</p><p>And don’t overlook the customer service options the lender has available. For example, if you prefer to communicate by phone, check that a phone number is easy to find, and call to make sure you don’t get lost in a never-ending phone tree. If you prefer to communicate by app, make sure the lender has one and that the app’s reviews are generally positive.</p><h3>6. Apply for the loan</h3><p>Once you’ve reviewed potential options and found the best personal loan that meets your criteria, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply for the loan</a>. If you need a personal loan with fair credit or bad credit, you may want to consider taking steps to improve your score before you apply, if possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Be prepared to provide documentation supporting your income like pay stubs, bank statements, or a benefit verification letter if you receive Social Security benefits.</p><p>If <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">approved for the loan</a>, review the agreement carefully and note the repayment amount, APR, monthly payment, and when the first payment is due. Once approved, you could receive money the same day, depending on the lender.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:307862":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"307862","content":"<h2>Interest rates and loan amounts by income</h2><p>Borrowers with high credit scores are the most likely to qualify for the lowest interest rates and highest loan amounts.

Credit unions tend to offer lower rates than banks and online lenders.</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner:</strong> If you have a friend or family member with good credit, they can help you get a loan by <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">applying with you as a cosigner</a>. Their credit profile will provide some reassurance to the lender. However, if you fail to make payments, they’ll be responsible for your debt, so make sure you can afford repayment.</li><li><strong>Apply for a joint personal loan:</strong>&nbsp;A small number of lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\">joint personal loans</a>, which are available to co-applicants. Adding a co-applicant with a higher income and a good credit score could improve your chances of qualifying.

No-interest loans exist in various forms, such as “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) apps and cash advance apps. However, “no-interest” or “zero-interest” doesn't necessarily mean zero cost.</p><p>These loans may come with strings attached, and in some cases, could cost more than a loan that charges standard interest. Here's a closer look at 0% interest loans and what you need to know.</p><h2>Is it possible to get an interest-free loan?</h2><p>Yes, it's possible to get interest-free loans, but most are for short-term financing needs and need to be repaid within two weeks to a few months. Loan amounts are typically limited as well. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\"><strong>Buy now, pay later</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some retailers and financial services companies offer BNPL options. As long as you make payments as agreed — often in four biweekly payments — you can avoid paying interest. However, BNPL loans may charge fees for late or missed payments.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Apps like Earnin and Klover use your next paycheck as collateral to lend small amounts of cash. These apps typically don't charge interest but may have fees, such as a monthly membership or instant transfer fees. More importantly, because of short repayment periods and fees, the cost of using a cash advance app could be the equivalent of paying more than 300% APR.</li><li><strong>Payroll advance financing:</strong> You might be able to get a paycheck advance or earned wage access through your employer. These advances may not be 100% interest-free, but if interest is charged, it's typically much lower than other short-term options such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Payment plans from healthcare providers or organizations:</strong> Healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and physicians' offices, might be willing to create an interest-free payment plan for you to encourage payment. Healthcare payment financing services offer loans or lines of credit with no or low interest, although some might charge deferred interest.</li><li><strong>Educational scholarships and emergency student loan programs:</strong> Some schools offer interest-free emergency student loans or interest-free scholarships through financial aid offices and scholarship programs. However, loan amounts may be small, and a co-signer may be required.</li><li><strong>Carmaker auto financing:</strong> Occasionally, some car manufacturers may offer interest-free 0% financing on new cars. Only those with very good or excellent credit are likely to get approved for 0% APR financing.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\"><strong>0% APR credit cards</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some credit card issuers offer introductory 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers, with introductory periods lasting up to 21 months before the regular APR applies. Remember that you'll need to pay for the purchase or balance transfer in full before the introductory offer ends to avoid interest.</li></ul><p>Some credit cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, that is added to the card's balance. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% balance transfer fee would cost $150.</p><p>If you're a student, ask your school about emergency student loans. For example, the Marshall University Emergency Loan Program provides one loan of up to $250 per semester if you have a financial emergency.</p><p>Moreover, nonprofits like the Jewish Free Loan Association offer emergency, business, education, and wellness loans with 0% interest or fees to all types of borrowers. You can get up to $15,000 for a personal emergency loan with two qualified guarantors. Guarantors are similar to cosigners and agree to cover your debt if you can't repay it.</p>"},"strapiMarketingBanner:2":{"__typename":"strapiMarketingBanner","id":"2","slug":"financial-tools","title":"Get your financial goals on track","titleColor":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"neutral700"},"description":"Free credit score, automatic debt tracking, and goal setting all in one place.","descriptionColor":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary700"},"bgColors":[{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"green100"},{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary300"}],"cta":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedCta","text":"Get Started","href":"/login?redirectTo=%2Fhub%2Ffinancial-tools","variant":"contained","size":"small","leftIcon":null,"rightIcon":null,"color":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary500"}},"image":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/95cb9c03-4b52-48e6-96e0-20999155becb","alternativeText":null}},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:236962":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"236962","content":"<h2>Interest-free loans vs. personal loans</h2><p>If you prefer a more straightforward way of borrowing money, consider taking out a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a>.

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees. Terms typically range from a couple of weeks to 21 months, but high-ticket items, like cars, may have terms of 48 months or more.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, say you purchased a new car for $30,000 with a $5,000 down payment and 0% financing for 48 months. Paying off the remaining $25,000 balance would mean making 48 monthly payments of $521. Although you can avoid interest with a 0% APR financing if you repay on time, missed payments could lead to cancellation of the zero-interest offer. You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.</p><p>Another example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone. With the typical BNPL loan, you’d pay $250 upfront and agree to make three more biweekly payments of $250. You’ll likely be charged a late fee if you&nbsp;miss a payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Both these examples might truly be no-cost loans. But some no-interest loans are high-cost. For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5. Since the loan is due in two weeks, the cost is equivalent to an 87% APR. If you add a $2 tip to the $5 instant transfer fee, the cost is equivalent to a 122% APR.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:236974":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"236974","content":"<h2>Why are zero-interest loans risky?</h2><p>There are three main features that make many no-interest loans a risky proposition: short repayment times, deferred interest, and ease of approval.

Longer-term loans, like personal loans, often have <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">years-long repayment periods</a>, which can mean much lower payments.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, if you take out a $500 cash advance via a cash app to cover an emergency expense, the entire $500 would be due with your next paycheck.

Options include <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, fertility clinic financing, home equity loans, and 401(k) loans. Personal loans are a popular option because they offer quick funding and predictable monthly payments.</p><h3>How does IVF financing work?</h3><p>Each IVF loan type works a little differently, but the lender typically gives you the money to pay your fertility treatment provider, and you repay the lender with interest over time. For example, a personal loan lender typically provides the money as a lump sum of cash, sometimes deducting an upfront fee known as an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>. You repay the loan with interest over a period that generally lasts two to seven years.</p><p>Most personal loans are unsecured and come with fixed interest rates, particularly loans offered by fintech lenders. An unsecured loan means you won't need to provide an asset as collateral, and your monthly payments remain the same for the life of the loan. “This may help with cash flow, allowing you to maintain a routine budget/savings rate, and spreading out the payment can help make sure you don't run into larger debt issues,” explains Matt Fizell, CFP, NAPFA Advisor Bureau Member, and Owner of Harmony Wealth.</p><h2>IVF financing options</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:244770":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"244770","content":"<ul><li><strong>Personal loans:</strong> You can get a personal loan from a bank, credit union, or online lender. Depending on your credit score and income and the lender, you may qualify for a loan of up to $100,000 or more. Personal loans are typically funded in a lump sum within a few days. A modest number of online lenders, banks, and credit unions offer personal loans specifically for IVF or other fertility treatments.</li><li><strong>Fertility clinic financing:</strong>&nbsp;Some clinics offer discounted infertility packages, in-house payment plans that are interest-free, or low-APR options through third-party medical lenders. “In clinics, each one's financial policy is different. This can be something to ask about or consider when choosing a doctor or clinic,” Feder says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fertility loans:</strong>&nbsp;Some lending platforms offer fertility loans directly to the patient that can only be used for IVF-related expenses.

But rather than providing a lump sum, it works like a credit card that you can withdraw cash from repeatedly and pay off as you go. HELOCs typically feature an interest-only payment period. They can be useful for IVF treatment because you don’t always know the total amount you’ll need to pay the clinic upfront.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>401(k) loans:</strong>&nbsp;Many retirement plan sponsors allow 401(k) loans.

Some companies, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lilyfertility.com/\">Lily Fertility</a>, provide insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly premium. The coverage provides a payout if IVF is unsuccessful.

Lender fees tend to be around 1% of the loan amount, which means working with Filo may save you a few thousand dollars, depending on how much you borrow.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Close in three weeks: </strong>Once your bid is accepted by the seller, Filo immediately begins the underwriting process and promises to close within 21 days. While the timespan to close depends on a few factors, it’s not uncommon for the process to take up to 43 days if you work with another lender.</li><li><strong>Great rates:</strong> Filo Mortgage rates are some of the lowest rates you’ll find. All of its fixed-rate <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-fixed-rate-mortgage\">mortgages</a> currently start in the 5% range. The rate you receive will depend on your credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio (DTI) and down payment amount. Filo also offers 5-, 7-, and 10-year <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/adjustable-rate-mortgage\">adjustable-rate mortgages</a> (ARMs).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Match guarantee: </strong>If you find a competitor with a lower rate and no origination fees, Filo Mortgage will match its loan cost and give you $1,000 at closing.</li><li><strong>Wide range of loan options: </strong>Filo Mortgage doesn’t just offer conventional loan options. It also has VA, FHA, USDA, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-jumbo-loan\">jumbo</a>&nbsp;loans available.</li></ul><h3>Cons&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><strong>Not licensed in every state: </strong>Filo doesn’t do business in every state. Currently, it’s only licensed to do business in 28 states. Before you start checking a lender’s rates, make sure it’s licensed in your state.</li><li><strong>Not a mortgage broker: </strong>When you submit an application to a mortgage broker, you receive possible rates from multiple lenders. If you choose to work directly with Filo, you will have to apply with other lenders on your own to properly compare rates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>No live chat or app: </strong>If you have a question, Filo Mortgage customer service doesn’t currently offer a live chat option. However, it does offer customer support via phone or email. It also doesn’t currently offer an app, so if you’re looking for a lender that offers that option to make your application or future payments easier, Filo Mortgage may not be the best fit.</li></ul><h2>What to consider before applying</h2><ul><li><strong>Timing: </strong>When determining if <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/should-i-buy-a-house\">you should buy a house</a>, the first question you need to ask is whether it’s the right time for you to buy. If you’re thinking about switching jobs in the near future, you may want to hit pause on buying a home. Lenders typically don’t like to see borrowers switch jobs while they’re in the middle of buying a home.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Down payment and closing costs: </strong>Unless you plan on using a USDA or VA loan, you will need to make, at a minimum, a 3% down payment with a conventional loan or a 3.5% with an FHA. However, you’re likely to receive a lower rate if you make a higher down payment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Credit score: </strong>Have you checked your credit score or credit reports recently? If your score is lower than you thought it would be, read through each of your credit reports, which you can do for free at <a href=\"http://annualcreditreport.com\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. While the name suggests you can only review your reports once a year for free, you can now do so once a week.</li><li><strong>DTI: </strong>Many lenders prefer that a borrower’s mortgage only take up a maximum of 28% of their gross monthly income. However, they may also prefer for all of your debts combined to only reach a maximum of 36% — including your potential mortgage payment. If you have other debts, you may want to consider lowering some of them before you apply for a mortgage.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How to apply for a loan with Filo Mortgage&nbsp;</h2><p>The Filo Mortgage application process can be broken down into five steps:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Fill out the necessary forms: </strong>You can apply for a Filo Mortgage entirely online. During this initial step, Filo will likely ask for a government-issued ID and proof of income.</li><li><strong>E-sign disclosure forms: </strong>The disclosure forms should tell you the cost of taking out a Filo Mortgage, as well as your expected total monthly payment.</li><li><strong>Submit required documentation:</strong> During <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval-documents\">pre-approval</a>, Filo Mortgage will likely need additional documentation. This may include tax returns, bank statements and other financial documents.</li><li><strong>Conditional approval: </strong>Once you’ve been approved for a loan from underwriting, Filo Mortgage might request other documentation, such as a property appraisal and proof of insurance. Once these issues have been addressed, a close date will be scheduled.</li><li><strong>Close:</strong> When it’s time to officially close, Filo Mortgage will send a notary to your house. Sign the documents, get your keys and move into your new home.</li></ol><h2>How to qualify for a loan with Filo Mortgage&nbsp;</h2><p>If Filo Mortgage operates in your state, keep in mind that Filo looks at the same variables as the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/best-mortgage-lenders\">best mortgage lenders</a> on the market. This means Filo Mortgage will also take a look at your credit score, DTI, annual and monthly income, and down payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Also remember that Filo offers multiple loan products, some of which have lower requirements than others, such as first-time homebuyer loans like Fannie Mae’s HomeReady or Freddie Mac’s Home Possible. If you don’t qualify for a conventional mortgage, this may be the route to go.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to refinance with Filo Mortgage</h2><p>Even if you already have a mortgage, you may want to consider a Filo Mortgage refinance. If your credit score or income has improved since you took out your mortgage, or rates have lowered since you bought your house, then it may be worth considering.</p><p>Refinancing is very similar to taking out a regular mortgage. You’ll apply online and submit various documents, such as bank statements and tax returns. With a refinance, you’ll also be asked to submit your current mortgage paperwork.</p><p>If you’re approved, you’ll need to select a new term. Filo Mortgage offers terms from 10 to 30 years. As with a regular mortgage, you’ll need to close and pay closing costs.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Filo Mortgage compares&nbsp;</h2><p>Zero lender fees, low rates, and fast closing times certainly make Filo Mortgage stand out. However, no matter which lender you choose, always compare it to its peers. Look at rates, closing times, fees and customer reviews. Sometimes a lender may seem great on paper, but it’s unable to deliver a positive customer experience. That said, online reviews suggest that many borrowers have a good experience with Filo Mortgage. Customer reviews on the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/us/pa/conshohocken/profile/mortgage-lenders/filo-mortgage-llc-0241-236043147\">Better Business Bureau’s</a> website give the lender 4.73 stars out of 5.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:297626":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"297626","content":"<p>Losing a steady income can seriously disrupt your budget, especially with student loan payments due.

The following changes affect parent PLUS loan forgiveness:</p><ul><li><strong>Elimination of ICR: </strong>The Income-Contingent Repayment plan will be closed by July 1, 2028. If you're not on ICR yet, you'll need to consolidate your parent PLUS loans and apply for ICR before July 1, 2026. You can remain on that plan or switch to another income-driven repayment plan until July 1, 2028.</li><li><strong>Introduction of new repayment plans: </strong>Starting in July 2026, there will be 2 new repayment plans: a Standard Repayment Plan that spans 10 to 25 years, depending on your loan amount, and a 30-year Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which adjusts your payments based on your income. New parent PLUS loans taken out on or after July 1, 2026, will only be eligible for the Standard Plan, not RAP.</li><li><strong>Transition to RAP or IBR: </strong>If you take out parent PLUS loans before July 1, 2026, you can repay them under the ICR plan until July 1, 2028. At that point, eligible loans will be transitioned to the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP); any loans that aren't eligible for RAP will be placed on the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan.</li></ul><p>“[These changes] mean that old borrowers are eligible for PSLF, but not new borrowers,” says Mark Kantrowitz, financial aid expert and author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>“Technically, parent PLUS loans will remain eligible for PSLF, but with the only available repayment plan being Standard Repayment,” he continues. “There would be no debt remaining after 10 years.”</p><h2>How to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness</h2><p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers parent PLUS loan forgiveness after 10 years of full-time work in the public sector. Qualifying employers include:</p><ul><li>Not-for-profit organizations</li><li>U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government</li><li>U.S. military</li></ul><p>Along with working as a public servant for a decade, you have to make 120 qualifying payments on an income-driven repayment plan.

You could qualify for a parent PLUS loan discharge if it was taken out as a result of identity theft.</li><li><strong>Disability: </strong>If you become totally and permanently disabled, you could have the loan discharged.

Many states offer loan repayment programs for health care providers, lawyers, or other professionals who work in shortage areas. Some employers also provide student loan benefits, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">tuition reimbursement,</a>&nbsp;to help their employees pay off their student debt.</p><h2>Is parent PLUS loan forgiveness right for you?</h2><p>Parent PLUS loan forgiveness may be right for you if you're committed to working in public service for at least a decade. It could also be a good fit for low-income borrowers who need relief from an income-driven repayment plan. However, your options for parent PLUS loan forgiveness will be restricted in the future due to legislative changes.</p><p>An alternative repayment strategy to consider is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/should-I-refinance\">student loan refinancing</a>. Depending on your credit profile, you could qualify for a better interest rate than you have now, which could lead to savings. You'll also get to choose a new repayment term, typically anywhere from five to 20 years.</p><p>Note that <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/refinance-federal-student-loans\">refinancing federal student loans</a> moves them to a private lender. As a result, your loans will no longer be eligible for federal forgiveness programs or repayment plans. If you can qualify for parent PLUS loan forgiveness, you're better off keeping your loans where they are.</p><p>If not, refinancing may be worth exploring for the potential savings it could offer on your student loans.

Academic struggles, social difficulties, and physical health issues are also common factors.</p><p>Some students take a short break with plans to return the next semester or academic year, while others step away indefinitely. The decision to return to the same school or transfer elsewhere can also affect how long a break lasts.</p><h2>How taking a break affects financial aid</h2><p>Taking time off from college can impact your financial aid, as federal aid eligibility assumes continuous enrollment.</p><p>“You're no longer eligible for federal financial aid if you drop below half-time enrollment,” says Dr. Darla Bishop, author of “How To Afford College.”</p><p>“And if your break lasts longer than six months, you will have to begin repayment on any federal student loans,” she adds.</p><p>If you return to school after a leave of absence, your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">student loans</a> will go back to “in-school deferment” status. However, taking a break can still affect your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/how-long-to-pay-off\">repayment timeline</a>.</p><p>“If you take a leave of absence for a full year or even just a semester, the grace period will be exhausted by the end of the leave of absence, so you will not have a grace period when you ultimately graduate,” says Mark Kantrowitz, author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>Loans aren't the only type of aid affected by a break in enrollment. Scholarships and grants may also be at risk.</p><p>“Students who leave at the end of a semester or academic year can just decline grants or scholarships for the upcoming semester,” Bishop says. “But the rules get wonky if you leave in the middle of a semester.”</p><p>If you leave mid-semester, you may be required to repay grant and scholarship funds that were tied to your academic performance, such as maintaining a certain GPA. But there are ways to avoid this.</p><p>“Try to stay until the end of the semester or negotiate for incompletes for the term, which gives you several weeks into the next semester to complete the coursework,” advises Bishop.</p><h2>How to take a break from college</h2><p>Taking a leave of absence requires certain paperwork, even in an emergency. You'll need to understand your school's leave of absence policy and notify your school of the upcoming break.</p><p>“There's a lot of timeliness for certain types of notification,” says Bishop. “If you have to leave suddenly, you may miss a deadline, which could affect your ability to get future financial aid.”</p><p>If you're considering a leave of absence, Bishop recommends taking the following steps to prepare:</p><ol><li><strong>Meet with your academic adviser: </strong>Your adviser can walk you through your school's leave of absence policies and help you complete any required paperwork.</li><li><strong>Check with the Office of Student Affairs: </strong>This may also be called the Office of Student Services. This department can guide you through the re-enrollment process and help ensure you remain eligible for financial aid when you return.</li><li><strong>Talk to the financial aid office:</strong> A leave of absence can impact your student loans, grants, and scholarships. The financial aid office can explain how your break will affect your aid and what steps you need to take.</li><li><strong>Plan for health care and housing:</strong> If your school provides your health insurance or housing, you'll need a plan to cover these expenses while you're on leave.</li></ol>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:11066":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"11066","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:248490":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"248490","content":"<h2>Managing student loans during a college break</h2><p>Taking a break from college can affect your student loans.

Some lenders offer longer repayment terms, but you may need to take out a larger loan amount to qualify.</p><p>The repayment term indicates not just how long you'll make payments on the loan, but how long you'll pay interest. In other words, you'll generally pay more interest on a longer-term loan. This is why it's best to get a loan with the shortest repayment term and monthly payment you can comfortably afford.</p><h3>Monthly payment</h3><p>Your monthly payment is determined by multiple factors, including your loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. By changing any of these three main inputs on a loan calculator, you will get a different monthly payment estimate. Your goal is to get one you can comfortably afford.</p><h3>Total repayment costs</h3><p>This gives you the big picture. Over time, interest adds up. If your loan is shorter, your monthly payments will be higher, but your total repayment costs will be less. Conversely, if you stretch your monthly payments over a longer period, your monthly payments will be less, but your total repayment costs will be more.</p><p>If you want to limit the total interest paid over the life of your loan, shorten your loan term.

You can get traditional financing through the motorcycle dealership or even through the manufacturer, but you can also apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> with an online lender, bank, or credit union to finance your ride.</p><p>Financing through the dealership or manufacturer might require a down payment, and a personal loan might carry an origination fee. The former typically means the motorcycle serves as collateral (a <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>), while personal loans don’t require you to use the bike as collateral. Otherwise, these two types of loans work pretty similarly:</p><ul><li>You apply for financing and, if approved, use the funds to pay for the motorcycle.</li><li>You make monthly payments (<a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>) over a set number of years until the loan is paid off.</li><li>Each payment consists of a principal balance (the amount you borrow) plus interest. Note that if the lender charges fees upfront (like an origination fee) and wraps them into the loan, you'd be paying that off too.</li></ul><h3>Is taking out a motorcycle loan a good idea?</h3><p>Taking out a motorcycle loan&nbsp;could be a good idea in the right circumstances. If you intend to use the motorcycle as your primary means of transportation, a motorcycle loan makes a lot of sense. It is likely going to be less than a car payment (the average cost of a new car is nearly $50,000), and motorcycles are also cheaper to fuel and typically cheaper to insure.</p><p>However, if the motorcycle is a luxury purchase — a hobby, and not your primary means of transportation — it’s better to save up and pay cash. We recommend only financing a motorcycle as a luxury purchase if you:</p><ul><li>Have an established <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a></li><li>Have paid down other major debts (especially high-interest credit cards)</li><li>Have disposable income each month</li></ul><h2>Ways to finance your motorcycle</h2><p>You can get a personal loan to finance your motorcycle from an online lender, but banks and credit unions are also viable options. Alternatively, the dealership may offer financing, or you can look for financing through the motorcycle manufacturer itself.</p><h3>Online personal loan lenders</h3><p>An <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lender</a> is a great place to look for a personal loan, and as long as you have fair or better credit and steady income, you should be able to qualify for an unsecured loan to cover the cost. (<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Personal loan requirements</a> vary by lender.)</p><p>Most online lenders offer same- or next-day funding once you’re approved, and because these lenders have low overhead, they often have very competitive interest rates. The&nbsp;best personal loans have rates as low as 6.49%, but rates can go as high as 35.99%. Right now,&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">average personal loan rates</a> are hovering around 14% to 20%, depending on your loan term and credit score.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:246338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"246338","content":"<p>You can usually get a personal loan for anywhere from $2,000 to $50,000, which should be enough to cover the cost of a motorcycle, even a luxury model.

Personal loan requirements vary by lender, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score for a personal loan</a> is usually in the 600s (though some lenders may approve you with a lower score).</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:246350":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"246350","content":"<h3>Compare annual percentage rates (APRs)</h3><p>Get prequalified with multiple lenders to see which offers the lowest <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">annual percentage rate</a> (APR) and best terms.

If you’re buying a used motorcycle or already have some cash saved up, prioritize lenders that offer small amounts, such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/universal-credit-personal-loans-review\">Universal Credit</a> ($1,000 minimum) and <a href=\"/personal-loan/upgrade-personal-loans-review\">Upgrade</a> ($1,000 minimum).</p><p>Dealership and manufacturer financing, as well as motorcycle loans from banks and credit unions, should be for the exact amount you need to finance — and not a cent more. That could make them more attractive if you’re trying to borrow the bare minimum.</p><h3>Weight the cost of down payments and origination fees</h3><p>Some manufacturers and dealerships advertise zero-money-down financing, but that’s often reserved for borrowers with excellent credit. Otherwise, be prepared to make a down payment on your motorcycle, much like an auto loan.</p><p>If you don’t have enough cash for a down payment (or have that cash earmarked for something else), a personal loan could be the better option. Personal loans don’t require down payments, though you might be charged an origination fee, which gets folded into the loan.</p><h3>Try to have financing&nbsp;before&nbsp;going to a dealer</h3><p>Get prequalified with online lenders or visit a local bank or credit union to explore financing options before heading to a dealership. You can also explore financing through the manufacturer online. Save dealership financing as a last resort.</p><p>Why? Some motorcycle dealers work with a network of lenders. Dealer markups and dealer reserves — in which the dealer earns a percentage of the loan amount or a fee from a lender and passes the cost along to you — can make dealer financing more expensive than borrowing from a lender directly.

Congress establishes those rates annually ahead of each school year.</p><p>“It’s not possible to lower rates when borrowing federal student loans,” Stacey MacPhetres, senior director of education finance for EdAssist by Bright Horizons, explains. “Interest rates reset annually, though. So it is possible that borrowers will have different interest rates for their federal student loans for each year they’re enrolled.”</p><p>The only way to obtain a lower interest rate on an existing federal loan is to refinance it into a private loan. But&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/refinance-federal-student-loans\">refinancing federal student loans</a> comes with significant drawbacks. We’ll discuss this option further later.</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/average-student-loan-interest-rates\">private student loan rates</a> vary widely based on the lender you choose, your credit score, and other factors. Shopping around, beefing up your credit score, and planning ahead before applying can — and often will — get you a more affordable interest rate.</p><h2>Improve your credit to qualify for lower rates</h2><p>If you’re applying for a private student loan, improving your credit score is one of the best things you can do for your interest rate.&nbsp;</p><p>“While secondary credit criteria, such as your debt-to-income ratio, duration of employment with your current employer, and income may affect eligibility for a private student loan, the interest rate depends primarily on your credit score and the credit score of the cosigner,” says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert.&nbsp;</p><p>Kantrowitz, author of “How To Appeal for More Financial Aid” and other books on the subject, notes that having a cosigner with good credit can also help you secure a lower interest rate. In fact, many undergraduate students applying for private student loans require cosigners to qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>“Most typical undergraduate students do not have enough established credit history to permit borrowing without a creditworthy cosigner,” MacPhetres says. “Therefore, most private lenders will require undergraduates to apply with another individual whose credit can support the borrowing criteria.”</p><p>Steps you can take to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/credit-score\">improve your credit score</a> include reducing your debts, setting your bills on autopayment (late payments can really ding your score), and disputing any errors you find on your credit report. Avoiding the opening of new accounts or lines of credit can also help.&nbsp;</p><h2>Refinance your student loans to get a better rate</h2><p>If you already have a student loan and want to reduce the interest rate you’re currently paying, refinancing is an option. This move replaces your loan (or multiple loans) with a new one that has a different term, rate, and other features.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/\">refinancing student loans</a> is a smart move depends on the rate you’re paying on your current student loan debt and what rate you could qualify for on a new loan.

These include potential loan forgiveness, income-based repayment plans, and other perks.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s important to understand what you may risk when refinancing student loans,” MacPhetres says. “Federal student loans have certain terms and protections that do not exist under private refinance programs.”</p><p>You also have the option to combine multiple federal student loans into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan. The difference between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/how-to-consolidate-student-loans\">federal student loan consolidation</a> and refinancing, however, is that consolidation doesn't lower your interest rate. Instead, the new rate is the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percent. The primary benefit is simplifying repayment by combining multiple loans into a single monthly payment. You also preserve the federal loan benefits.</p><h2>Other ways to reduce your student loan rate</h2><p>Another great way to reduce your student loan interest rate is to simply shop around.

An agent can help you from the initial home search to negotiations to simplifying legal documents to closing.</p><p>But not everyone feels the need to work with a real estate agent. In some cases, you might do just as well handling the process yourself.</p><p>“Buying a house without a realtor can work in specific scenarios, like when you're purchasing from someone you know, such as a family member, or if you’re experienced with real estate transactions and confident navigating the process,” says Brett Johnson, a licensed Colorado real estate agent and owner of New Era Home Buyers. “However, it’s important to know what you’re stepping into.”</p><p>Here are two instances where you might consider buying a house without an agent:</p><ul><li>You’re buying a for-sale-by-owner (FSBO) property that doesn’t require a complex transaction.</li><li>You’ve purchased property before and are familiar with the process.</li></ul><p>“Homebuyers with some previous experience are perfectly capable of buying a home without a real estate agent,” says Robert Washington, Founder and Broker at Savvy Buyers Realty. “First-time homebuyers should exercise caution when attempting to buy a home without an agent.”</p><h2>Steps to buying a house without a real estate agent</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step process of buying a home without a REALTOR® or other agent:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-budget-for-a-house\"><strong>Determine your homebuying budget</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Aim for homes that cost no more than two or three times your gross household income. If your household earns $150,000 a year, your home purchase budget would be $300,000 to $450,000. This depends on your other financial obligations and goals, however.</li><li><strong>Shop around for mortgage lenders: </strong>Interest rates, terms, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-a-mortgage\">loan types</a>, and eligibility criteria vary by lender. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage\">Compare options from multiple lenders</a> and narrow down your list.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved with several lenders: </strong>Pre-approval gives you a better idea of what you may qualify for, while showing sellers you’re a serious buyer. Applying for pre-approval involves a hard credit check that can lower your credit score, typically by a few points.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Research the local real estate market: </strong>With your budget in mind, start the house hunt. Review listings in your desired neighborhoods on homebuying platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com. You can also look into new construction developers in the area.</li><li><strong>Review the seller’s disclosure: </strong>This is a real estate document that lists any known issues about the home’s condition, defects, or other issues that could hurt the value of the home. This may include structural issues, the presence of harmful chemicals or materials (like radon, soil toxins, lead paint, or asbestos), and mold or water damage.</li><li><strong>Hire a real estate attorney: </strong>You may want to find an attorney to guide you through legal issues or look over complex documents.</li><li><strong>Put in an offer: </strong>If everything looks good, make your initial offer. Be sure to compare the values of similar homes in the area to get a better idea of a fair price.</li><li><strong>Order an appraisal: </strong>An appraisal determines the value of the property. Most home lenders require an appraisal to be completed before they’ll approve a loan.</li><li><strong>Get a home inspection done: </strong>You may also want to hire a third-party inspector to assess the home for any defects or recommendations. The home inspection process is primarily visual, so keep that in mind.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the seller: </strong>Based on the home inspection report and appraisal results, you can begin negotiating with the seller on necessary repairs or the final sales price. If they refuse or you can’t come to an agreement, you can back out of the sale.</li><li><strong>Formally apply for financing: </strong>Unless you’re paying in cash, you’ll need to apply for a home loan. You can request several mortgage quotes before applying for a loan. Comparing at least four quotes can save you between $600 and $1,200 per year.</li><li><strong>Close on your home: </strong>A few days before closing, you’ll receive several documents, including the final closing disclosure. Review everything for accuracy, then <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/closing-on-a-home\">head to the scheduled closing meeting</a>. Be prepared to show a government-issued ID and sign the final documents before receiving the keys. You’ll also need to pay any upfront costs — like a down payment and closing fees — prior to closing on the home.</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:14398":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"14398","content":"<h2>Pros and cons of buying a home without an agent</h2><p>Here are the main advantages of buying a house without an agent:</p><ul><li><strong>You’ll save money on fees: </strong>Both the buyer’s and seller’s real estate agents charge commission fees. These are usually 5% to 6% of the home sale price, split between both agents. This means you could save up to 3% by forgoing a buying agent.</li><li><strong>You’ll have more control over the process: </strong>An agent acts as a middleman between you and the seller. Without one, you can communicate and negotiate with the seller directly, which could save you some time.</li><li><strong>You’ll learn as you go: </strong>Since you’re on your own, you’re more likely to learn more about the homebuying process than you thought possible. This can be useful if you plan to buy property again in the future.</li><li><strong>The process could be quicker: </strong>If you’re <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/buying-a-house-for-sale-by-owner\">purchasing an FSBO home</a>, meaning the seller also doesn’t have an agent, the transaction could be quicker. In fact, the National Association of REALTORS® found that FSBO homes sold <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/fsbos-reach-all-time-low-more-sellers-rely-on-agents\">in a median of one week</a>, compared to three weeks for homes sold via an agent.</li></ul><p>“The biggest benefit of using a REALTOR® is the ability to utilize their knowledge and expertise. Every transaction is their own beast, and odds are that an experienced agent has dealt with any issues that may arise in the homebuying process,” says Washington.</p><p>Going through homebuying alone has a few drawbacks as well, including:</p><ul><li><strong>The process can be lengthy: </strong>Buying a home is often a complicated process with many legal and financial documents and real estate jargon to sift through. If you’re not prepared, you could spend a lot more time on research and negotiations than you expected.</li><li><strong>You may have trouble negotiating a fair price: </strong>Negotiating without a REALTOR® can be tricky. An agent will typically do a comparative real estate market analysis to ensure you’re putting in a fair offer. Without their expertise, you could end up paying too much.</li><li><strong>You may have limited home options: </strong>Only brokers and licensed real estate agents have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which gives them access to a large pool of property listings. Without one, you’ll be limited to third-party platforms and their listings.</li></ul><p>“You’ll need to handle the intricate details, like paperwork, inspections, and navigating local real estate laws, which can be overwhelming,” said Johnson. “In my experience, buyers who skip hiring a realtor often underestimate the time and expertise required to avoid costly mistakes.”</p><p>Take some time to consider your options and whether using an agent is the best option for you.</p><h2>Key professionals you’ll need without an agent</h2><p>Even if you decide to buy a house without an agent, you may want to enlist the help of a few other professionals, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Home inspector: </strong>A third-party inspector could find defects or other serious issues with the house, like an old roof that should be replaced. This can save you money down the line.</li><li><strong>Real estate appraiser: </strong>The appraiser will evaluate the property to determine its fair market value. Mortgage lenders typically require an appraisal, but knowing the home’s assessed value can also help you during negotiations.</li></ul><p>It might also be a good idea to have a real estate attorney for your home purchase. An experienced attorney can review the purchase agreement and any other legal documents to ensure you’re making an informed decision.</p><p>Other professionals typically involved with residential real estate transactions include:</p><ul><li>Closing representative</li><li>Mortgage lender or servicer</li><li>Loan officer</li><li>Loan processor</li><li>Loan underwriter</li></ul><h2>Tips for negotiating without a realtor</h2><p>Negotiating without a realtor is crucial to ensuring you’re getting a good deal. The process can take time, but don’t try to rush. You’ll want to get a fair price and finalize any issues or repairs before committing to anything.</p><p>“For negotiations, research is your best tool,” Johnson says. “Start with a comparative market analysis (CMA) to understand fair market value.”</p><p>Also, take some time to understand the seller’s motivations.</p><p>“I’ve successfully negotiated deals by identifying sellers’ motivations — if they’re moving for a job, for example, they might prioritize a fast closing over the highest price,” Johnson says. “Asking strategic questions like ‘Why are you selling?’ can reveal opportunities to craft an offer that benefits both parties.”</p><p>Last but not least, try to stay objective and work with the seller to ensure you’re both walking away satisfied.</p><p>“Sellers are often concerned about timing and being amenable to their schedule can really help a buyer get a leg up in any negotiation,” Washington says. “Buyers should keep their emotions in check during the negotiation process. Sometimes negotiations feel like a battle and people walk away from deals due to issues that end up being petty and irrelevant.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:311678":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"311678","content":"<p>If you and a partner, friend, or spouse are looking for a personal loan that you'll both use and repay, a joint personal loan may be a good choice.

An <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is usually a percentage of your total loan amount (1% to 10% is a common range) that is taken from your loan before you receive the money. For example, if you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/1000-loan\">borrow $1,000</a> with a 5% origination fee, the lender will automatically deduct the $50 origination fee and disburse the remaining $950 to you.</li><li><strong>Repayment term:</strong> This is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">how long you will be making your monthly payments</a> on the loan, usually anywhere from 1 year to 7 years (or more, depending on the lender and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">loan purpose</a>). Longer terms generally mean lower monthly payments, but a higher overall cost. Choose the shortest term with a payment you can comfortably afford.</li><li><strong>Loan amount:</strong> If you're looking for a particularly small or large personal loan, find a lender that offers the amount you need. Prequalify with multiple lenders to get a sense of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">how much of a personal loan you can get</a>. If you have a low credit score, a small income, or a high debt-to-income ratio, you may struggle to find a lender that will lend you a large (or any) amount.</li><li><strong>Time to fund:</strong> If you need money fast, look for the lender's average funding time. Some lenders like LightStream and SoFi can send money the same day you apply, but most take 1 to 3 business days once you're approved. Things like delays in providing documentation, what time of day you apply, and your bank's policies can all impact when you receive your money.</li></ul><h2>How do I apply for a joint personal loan?</h2><p>The actual process to apply varies from lender to lender, but here are the most important steps:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li><strong>Discuss with your co-borrower:</strong> How much are you borrowing and for how long? Will you be splitting the cost of each monthly payment? How much payment can you afford? Do you agree on exactly how you'll use the money?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Check your credit scores:</strong> If one (or both) of your scores is low, <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">take the time to boost it</a> prior to applying to improve your chances of qualifying or getting a lower interest rate. Check the lender's minimum credit score requirement before applying as well.</li><li><strong>Prequalify for multiple loans:</strong> Many lenders allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a loan</a>. This means entering basic personal information, estimated income, and other details. You can get an estimate of the rates and terms you may be eligible for and which lenders are likely to approve your application. Prequalification is not an offer of credit, and your final rate could be different.</li><li><strong>Compare terms:</strong> Once you have quotes from multiple lenders, compare <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APRs</a>, loan amounts, repayment terms, and other factors like origination fees. Find the lowest-cost loan with a monthly payment you are confident you can afford.</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> Once you've identified the best option, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete the formal loan application</a>. At this point, most lenders conduct a hard credit check, which could bring your score down temporarily.</li><li><strong>Review the loan offer: </strong>If approved, review the rate, monthly payment amount, repayment term, and any upfront fees. If all looks well, sign to move forward.</li><li><strong>Prepare for repayment:</strong> Once you receive your funds, make sure you're prepared to repay your loan in full and on time. Set up automatic payments, or create a calendar reminder.</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:311718":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"311718","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated 32 lenders across 1,216 data points to find the best joint personal loans.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

An <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="origination-fee.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">origination fee</a> is usually a percentage of your total loan amount (1% to 10% is a common range) that is taken from your loan before you receive the money. For example, if you <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="1000-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">borrow $1,000</a> with a 5% origination fee, the lender will automatically deduct the $50 origination fee and disburse the remaining $950 to you.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment term:</strong> This is <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-term-length.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">how long you will be making your monthly payments</a> on the loan, usually anywhere from 1 year to 7 years (or more, depending on the lender and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-are-personal-loans-used-for.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">loan purpose</a>).

Some lenders like LightStream and SoFi can send money the same day you apply, but most take 1 to 3 business days once you&#x27;re approved. Things like delays in providing documentation, what time of day you apply, and your bank&#x27;s policies can all impact when you receive your money.</li></ul><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-do-i-apply-for-a-joint-personal-loan">How do I apply for a joint personal loan?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The actual process to apply varies from lender to lender, but here are the most important steps:</p><ol class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR" style="list-style-type:decimal"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Discuss with your co-borrower:</strong> How much are you borrowing and for how long?

This means entering basic personal information, estimated income, and other details.

One guideline you can follow is the 28% rule, which suggests you spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. Let’s use the earlier example that assumes a 30-year loan term and 6% APR, which results in a monthly payment of $1,498.88. Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

An unsecured loan means you won't need to provide an asset as collateral, and your monthly payments remain the same for the life of the loan. “This may help with cash flow, allowing you to maintain a routine budget/savings rate, and spreading out the payment can help make sure you don't run into larger debt issues,” explains Matt Fizell, CFP, NAPFA Advisor Bureau Member, and Owner of Harmony Wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIVF financing options\u003c/h2\u003e"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:244770":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"244770","content":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal loans:\u003c/strong\u003e You can get a personal loan from a bank, credit union, or online lender.
