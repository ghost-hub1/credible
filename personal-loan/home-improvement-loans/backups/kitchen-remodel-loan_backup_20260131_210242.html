Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate. Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

You can choose from several repayment plans, including income-driven repayment, graduated repayment, and extended repayment that can span as long as 30 years. You also have the option to change your repayment plan at any time, which allows you to adjust your payments if your situation changes.

Common options include:</p><ul><li><strong>Immediate repayment:</strong>&nbsp;You start making full principal and interest payments as soon as the loan is disbursed. This keeps costs lower in the long run, but it means budgeting for payments while you’re in school.</li><li><strong>Interest-only payments:</strong>&nbsp;You pay only the interest that accrues while enrolled in school and postpone full repayment until after graduation. Covering your loan’s interest charges up front can help keep your balance from growing while you finish your degree.</li><li><strong>Fixed payments:</strong>&nbsp;Some lenders let you make small fixed payments, often around $25 a month. This may not cover all your accrued interest, but it can reduce some of it and help you get used to making monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Deferred repayment:</strong>&nbsp;You don’t make any payments while in school, and usually for a 6-month&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-grace-period\">grace period</a> after you graduate or leave school. However, interest still accrues during this time, so your balance will be higher once repayment begins.</li></ul><p>You must also choose a specific repayment term when you borrow, which is the length of time that you'll be paying back your loan.&nbsp;</p><p>“Most private student loans offer 10-, 12-, and 15-year terms,” says Mark Kantrowitz, financial aid expert and author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Some offer longer terms, such as 20 years, and some offer shorter terms, such as five or seven years,” he adds.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:276994":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"276994","content":"<h2>What if my monthly payments are too high?</h2><p>If your monthly private student loan payments are too high, your lender may have options to lower payments.

You may also get charged collection costs if your loan goes to collections.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Legal action:</strong>&nbsp;Your lender can bring you to court to demand repayment. If a court order is issued against you, the lender can garnish your wages. Note that your lender can only sue you before the loan's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/statute-limitations-private-student-loans\">statute of limitations</a> expires. This ranges from 3 to 15 years, depending on your state.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cosigner liability:</strong>&nbsp;If you have a cosigner on your loan, your cosigner will be expected to pay back the debt. Their credit will also get damaged in the event of nonpayment.</li></ul><p>Since the fallout from private loan default can be severe, take action before you start missing payments. Call your lender and ask about your options to avoid default. Avoid ignoring bills, or you could end up in an even more stressful situation.&nbsp;</p><p>“The sooner you reach out, the more options you'll have to prevent default,” advises McClary. “Proactive communication can make a big difference.”</p><h2>Refinancing to change your repayment terms&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Student loan refinancing</a> lets you replace your current private loans with a new loan from a private lender. This can give you the chance to adjust both your interest rate and repayment plan.&nbsp;</p><p>A lower interest rate could save you money over time, while a longer repayment term can reduce your monthly payment. Just be aware that extending your repayment term may increase the total interest you pay over time.&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for refinancing, you’ll need to meet a lender’s credit and income requirements or apply with a cosigner. Also, keep in mind that refinancing federal loans with a private loan means losing access to federal benefits like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">income-driven repayment plans</a>, payment relief options, and forgiveness programs.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:277002":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"277002","content":"<h2>Repayment policies to clarify with your lender&nbsp;</h2><p>Policies vary among private lenders, so communicate with yours if you have questions about how to repay private loans.

It’s expressed as a percentage.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage-refinance\">refinancing your home loan</a>, mortgage lenders use your LTV ratio to calculate your home equity and establish your maximum borrowing limit. If your LTV ratio is higher than 80%, you’ll need to pay <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-mortgage-insurance\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) until you reach that 80% threshold.</p><h2>How to calculate your LTV ratio</h2><p>You can calculate your LTV ratio by dividing your mortgage balance by your home value:</p><p><strong>Loan balance ÷ home appraisal value x 100 = LTV ratio</strong></p><p>For example, if your mortgage balance is $200,000 and your property value is $250,000, your LTV ratio would be 80%.</p><p>Use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/loan-to-value-calculator\">loan-to-value calculator</a> to help you dive into the numbers.</p><h3>Calculating your combined LTV ratio (CLTV)</h3><p>If you also have a <a href=\"/mortgage/home-equity-loan-vs-line-credit\">home equity loan or a home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC), be sure to combine both loan amounts to accurately calculate your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV).</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:13266":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"13266","content":"<p>For instance, say you have a mortgage balance of $200,000 and a home equity loan of $25,000. Your property value is $300,000. With the combined total of your loans, your CLTV ratio would be 75%.</p><h3>Using LTV to waive private mortgage insurance</h3><p>In addition to calculating your current LTV ratio, you can use this metric to estimate your maximum borrowing amount with a refinance and avoid private mortgage insurance. For instance, to meet the 20% equity threshold, you can multiply your home value by 0.8 (80%).</p><p><strong>Home value x 0.8 = maximum loan amount: </strong>For a $300,000 property, your total loan balance can be no more than $240,000. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck paying mortgage insurance until you reach 80% LTV.</p><h2>How does your LTV affect your refinancing?</h2><p>Your LTV ratio is one of the most important factors that impact your ability to refinance. For example, your lender may be more hesitant to accept a refinance application with an LTV ratio above 80%. You might end up paying higher fees and mortgage insurance as a result.</p><p>Your LTV ratio also helps determine your interest rate. Homeowners refinancing with high LTVs usually don’t qualify for the lowest <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance/rates\">mortgage refinance rates</a>.</p><p>The LTV ratio is only one of several factors that affect your ability to refinance. Some other important factors that impact your loan APR and monthly payment include:</p><ul><li>Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio</li><li>Credit score</li><li>Employment history</li><li>Repayment period (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance/rates/30-year-fixed\">30 years</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance/rates/15-year-fixed\">15 years</a>)</li><li>Standard refinance (no cash out) or a cash-out refinance</li></ul><h3>LTV ratio requirements</h3><p>There are several mortgage refinancing options available to you. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance-requirements\">Refinancing requirements</a>, including the maximum LTV ratio, vary by program.</p><p>However, having the following LTV ratio for your desired loan type can help you qualify for better rates and potentially allow you to waive mortgage insurance premiums.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:13270":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"13270","content":"<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan limits allow a maximum 95% LTV ratio for a standard (no cash-out) refinance on a single-family home. But, if you seek a cash-out refinance, your maximum LTV drops to 80%. The threshold is lower for second homes and investment properties.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/home-equity-loan-heloc-requirements\">requirements for a home equity loan and HELOC</a> are similar to a cash-out refinance, though some lenders may only require 15% equity or 85% CLTV. Still, to qualify for the best interest rates, you’ll want to aim for a CLTV ratio of 80% or less.</p><h2>How to improve your LTV ratio before refinancing</h2><p>There are several ways to lower your LTV ratio:</p><ul><li><strong>Pay down your mortgage:</strong> Your LTV ratio will go down over time as you make your mortgage payments. You can speed up this process by <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/early-mortgage-payoff-calculator\">making extra payments</a> toward your principal balance.</li><li><strong>Wait for your home value to increase:</strong> A good home location, healthy economy, and strong buyer demand can help boost your home value over time. Waiting for your home to appreciate might be your best option for lowering your LTV ratio if you don’t have the cash to make extra loan payments.</li><li><strong>Perform home improvements:</strong> Completing repairs and certain home improvements can boost your home’s curb appeal and appraised value. Some of these projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/solar-tax-credit\">solar panels</a>, may also be eligible for tax credits.</li><li><strong>Pay closing costs upfront:</strong> Setting aside some cash to cover your refinancing fees upfront instead of rolling them into the mortgage will minimize your total borrowing amount. Closing costs usually range between 2% and 5% of the loan amount.</li><li><strong>Choose a standard refinance:</strong> While avoiding a cash-out refinance means you can’t tap your home equity, you won’t have to borrow as much. Keeping your new loan balance as low as possible helps keep your LTV ratio low.</li><li><strong>Pursue a cash-in refinance:</strong> You can make a lump-sum payment before the closing date to supplement your existing home equity balance. Your lender may also let you apply gift funds from a qualified donor.</li></ul><h2>Factors that can worsen LTV ratios</h2><p>Here are some of the situations that can lead to higher LTVs and potentially hinder your ability to refinance.</p><h3>Declining property values</h3><p>Even if you’re following your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-amortization\">amortization schedule</a> and reducing your mortgage principal, declining home values reduce your available home equity.</p><p>If home values in your local market drop too much, your mortgage might go <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/underwater-mortgage\">underwater</a>. This means your current home value is less than the loan balance. When you’re underwater on your mortgage, you have a 100% LTV ratio or higher, and most likely won’t qualify for financing.</p><h3>Receiving a poor appraisal</h3><p>Your lender will require a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-appraisal\">home appraisal</a> to refinance your home loan. A low appraisal value reduces your cash-out amount and may also impact your rate.</p><p>Consider disputing some of the marks you believe are inaccurate and use this opportunity to complete repairs. The appraised value of the home may be higher after a second appraisal.</p><h3>Having a second mortgage</h3><p>It can be more difficult to refinance your first mortgage when you have an outstanding balance on a <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-second-mortgage\">second mortgage</a>, such as a home equity loan or HELOC. You may need to reduce or pay off your second mortgage balance to achieve the desired LTV ratio for refinancing.</p><h3>Applying for a cash-out refinance</h3><p>A cash-out refinance lets you borrow money at a potentially lower rate than a personal loan. However, tapping your home equity raises your LTV.</p><h3>Rolling closing costs into the loan</h3><p>Your lender may let you add your origination fees, funding fees, or mortgage insurance costs to the loan principal instead of making a lump-sum payment at closing. While you minimize your upfront costs by doing so, you also increase your total loan size.</p><h2>High LTV mortgage refinances</h2><p>Consider these homeownership programs when you have a higher LTV ratio and are finding it difficult to qualify for a conventional refinance:</p><ul><li><strong>Fannie Mae RefiNow:</strong> To qualify for a <a href=\"https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/originating-underwriting/mortgage-products/refinow-expanding-refinance-eligibility-qualifying-homeowners\">RefiNow loan</a>, you’ll need an LTV ratio of 97% or less, a debt-to-income ratio of 65% or less, an income at or below 100% of your area median income, and at least a 620 credit score. Your current mortgage must also be secured by Fannie Mae.</li><li><strong>Freddie Mac Refi Possible:</strong> The <a href=\"https://sf.freddiemac.com/working-with-us/origination-underwriting/mortgage-products/refi-possible\">Refi Possible</a> program allows a maximum LTV ratio of 97% and up to 65% DTI. You also need to have a low or moderate income (up to 100% of your area median income), and a minimum credit score of 620.</li><li><strong>FHA streamline refinance:</strong> There’s no maximum LTV ratio on an <a href=\"/mortgage/fha-streamline-refinance\">FHA streamline refinance</a>, however, a 90% LTV or lower allows you to waive the annual mortgage insurance premiums after 11 years. Lenders may require a minimum 580 credit score. This option is only available to borrowers with an existing FHA loan.</li><li><strong>VA streamline refinance:</strong> A VA interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL), also known as a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/va-streamline-refinance\">VA streamline refinance</a>, has a one-time funding fee of 0.5%. However, you don’t have to pay mortgage insurance. This program is only available to existing VA-insured borrowers.</li><li><strong>VA cash-out refinance:</strong> A VA cash-out refinance may let you withdraw all of your equity and allows up to 100% LTV. You can also refinance a non-VA loan using this option. However, you’ll pay a higher funding fee — up to 3.6%.</li><li><strong>USDA streamline refinance:</strong> Existing USDA direct and guaranteed loan borrowers are eligible for this type of refinance, as long as their new monthly payment is at least $50 lower than their current one. There is no home appraisal or maximum LTV, but the last 12 monthly payments must have been paid on time.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:304754":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"304754","content":"<p>More than half of undergraduates finish school with student loan debt, averaging $29,300, according to the College Board.

They’re available for amounts up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to 12 months. Terms and loan amounts depend on which type of loan you get, a PAL I or a PAL II.</p><p>Unlike payday loans, these are installment loans that have monthly payments, and their interest rates are capped at 28%. To be eligible, you must be or become a member of a federal credit union that offers them.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>To pay for a car repair with a credit card, you typically have two options. One is to put the repair bill on your credit card, adding it to the charges you have to pay off every month. Keep in mind that credit card interest rates average 21.39%, according to the Federal Reserve, and a very expensive repair might be more than your credit limit.</p><p>Option two is to use a 0% APR offer on a new credit card and pay off the repair interest-free for the duration of the intro offer, which could last between 6 and 21 months, depending on the card. However, qualifying for a 0% APR offer can be difficult if you have fair or bad credit. It’s best to pay off the balance before the intro offer expires and the card's regular APR goes into effect.</p><h3>Credit card cash advance</h3><p>With a credit card cash advance, you can withdraw a percentage of your credit limit in cash at your bank or an ATM. Although convenient, cash advances typically charge APRs around 30% and you can withdraw only up to 30% of your credit limit in most cases. They also involve fees, typically $10, and interest often begins accruing immediately with no grace period.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the limitations on how much you can withdraw, you might have trouble paying for a very expensive car repair with a credit card cash advance.

If your FICO score is considered good, above 670, you're more likely to be approved for a loan at a reasonable rate. Some personal loan lenders have minimum credit score requirements.</li><li><strong>Know how much you need to borrow:</strong> Review the work estimate you got from the mechanic. Do you need to borrow the entire amount, or do you plan to cover some on your own? You may want to consider borrowing more than the estimated amount, since that figure could change. If you do borrow more, be sure to repay what you don't use as soon as the car is fixed.</li><li><strong>Prequalify with multiple lenders:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> with a soft credit inquiry doesn't hurt your credit score and allows you to see the APRs, monthly payments, loan amounts, and terms you might qualify for with different lenders. Prequalification is not an offer of credit, however, and the rates and terms of a formal loan offer may differ. Also, a loan application with a hard credit inquiry can temporarily lower your credit score.</li><li><strong>Compare APRs and loan terms:</strong> Credible and other personal loan marketplaces let you prequalify with multiple lenders and compare quotes for APRs, loan amounts, repayment terms, and fees. If a lender quotes multiple options for repayment terms, use a&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to see monthly payments and interest costs over the life of the loan.

These loans have low maximums that generally cap out at $1,000 but often start lower the first time you borrow. Often, you borrow against your paycheck and are expected to repay your balance the next time you get paid.</p><p>Expedited payment fees, late fees, and subscription fees may apply. You can consider this option if you have poor credit or don't need to borrow much money, but avoid paying extra fees to expedite your payment.</p><h3>Home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>With a&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">HELOC</a>, you can borrow against the equity in your home. A home equity loan provides the funds in a lump sum, while a HELOC is a type of revolving credit that works similarly to a credit card. Home equity financing options typically offer lower interest rates than personal loans and credit cards, but:</p><ul><li>You generally need to have built up 15% to 20% equity in your home to qualify.</li><li>Approval can take weeks, making it a less viable option if you need to get your car back on the road right away.</li><li>Appraisal fees, <a href=\"/mortgage/what-are-closing-costs\">closing costs</a>, and other charges typically apply.</li><li>By using your home as collateral, defaulting could put you at risk of foreclosure.</li></ul><h3>Small Dollar Loan Program</h3><p>The Small Dollar Loan Program (SDL Program) issues government grants that allow qualifying institutions to offer small loans to unbanked and underbanked borrowers, meaning individuals with less access to financial services and credit. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) receive funding awards that they can use to provide eligible loans to qualifying consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>For loans to be funded with grants under this program, they must be $2,500 or less and repaid in installments, and lenders can't charge prepayment penalties and must report activity to the credit bureaus. Consumers can't get loans directly through the SDL Program. But if you think you might qualify for a CDFI loan, use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdfifund.gov/faq\">CDFI database</a> to find an institution near you.</p><h3>BNPL (Buy now, pay later)</h3><p>Some auto repair shops may work with BNPL providers as an option for financing auto repairs. For example, <a href=\"/personal-loan/affirm-personal-loans-review\">Affirm</a> works with repair shops, dealerships, and auto parts stores to help get you back on the road even if you don’t have the cash to pay upfront.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL providers</a> like Affirm may provide 0% financing if you can afford an initial down payment, then pay the loan back in three installments over six weeks.</p><h2>Auto repair loans to avoid</h2><p>Steer clear of the following auto repair loan types:</p><ul><li><strong>Payday loans:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> are a type of short-term loan with high fees and low borrowing limits. These are risky because they typically have to be repaid in as little as two weeks, which can lead to rolling over your loan or reborrowing to cover your debt. While payday loans don't charge interest, they generally charge sky-high fees per $100 borrowed that can equate to exorbitant rates. For example, $15 charged on a $100 two-week loan is equal to a 391% APR.</li><li><strong>Title loans:</strong> Title loans or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">car title loans</a> are short-term, high-interest-rate loans you open using your car title as collateral. These loans provide immediate funding but have very short repayment term lengths, usually one month or less, and exceptionally high monthly finance fees that come out to 300% APR or higher, plus a number of possible service fees. You also risk losing your car if you can't repay your debt.</li><li><strong>Pawnshop loans:</strong> Like title loans,&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loans</a> require collateral and carry high interest rates and monthly fees that may come out to 20% to 25% a month. You can use nearly any valuable item as <a href=\"/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">collateral</a>, such as jewelry or collectibles, but you agree to hand over that item permanently if you can't pay. These loans are opened with pawnshops and are easy to get, but they can be dangerous and costly for borrowers.</li></ul><h2>What is the average cost of auto repairs?</h2><p>Data from Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive estimates that the average car repair costs $548.32.

Use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">mortgage calculator</a> to estimate your monthly payment for different loan amounts, and make sure you factor in insurance, taxes, homeowners association (HOA) dues, maintenance, and other costs. This can help guide you toward the right price range to shop in.</li><li><strong>Pull your credit report:</strong> Review your credit report early. Lenders will use your credit score and overall credit history when they consider your loan application, and this can determine which loans, interest rates, and amounts you qualify for. Request copies from the three credit bureaus or <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> to gauge where you stand. If you find any late payments, errors, or accounts in collections, work on settling those before you apply for a loan.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for your loan: </strong>Get <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">pre-approved</a> for a mortgage before beginning your home search.

If the seller accepts, you can proceed with your chosen mortgage lender’s full application.</li><li><strong>Fill out your mortgage application: </strong>Complete your mortgage application, and submit any documentation the lender requires. Be prepared to provide recent tax returns, W-2s, and pay stubs.</li><li><strong>Wait for approval:</strong> Your loan application will be processed and underwritten.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list.

The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month.

However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

For example:</p><p>Bank of America’s Balance Assist loans are available up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and no interest. The loan is repaid in three equal monthly installments automatically from your Bank of America checking account, making it a much better option than payday loans and even cash apps for short-term borrowing.</p><p>U.S. Bank’s Simple Loan provides loans up to $1,000, also repaid in three monthly installments. The loan carries a flat fee of $6 for every $100 borrowed with automatic payments, which is equivalent to a 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> is a small-amount, short-term loan that doesn’t usually require a credit check. Payday loans often have APRs in the triple digits because of the short repayment period and very high fees, relative to the loaned amount. For example, a payday loan that charges $15 for every $100 borrowed has an APR of nearly 400%.</p><p>Many states have regulated or outright prohibited payday loans, and research by the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finds-payday-borrowers-continue-to-pay-significant-rollover-fees-despite-state-level-protections-and-payment-plans/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has found that payday loans often trap borrowers in a cycle of high-cost debt.

PALs are available from many federal credit unions and are designed to be utilized instead of payday loans.</p><p>Amounts can range up to $2,000, and repayment terms can extend to 12 months. Since interest rates are capped at 28%, a PAL is often a wise choice for a small, short-term loan.

That might not sound like much, but it’s the same as paying a nearly 300% APR. The lender may charge additional fees to roll over the loan from month to month if you can’t pay it off, making the cost of borrowing even higher.</p><h3>401(k) loans</h3><p><strong>Avoid if possible</strong></p><p>Some 401(k) plan providers let you <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\">borrow against your own retirement account</a>. Loans are usually limited to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. And you typically have five years to repay the loan, usually via payroll deductions, unless you leave your job. In that case, you may need to pay the remaining balance immediately or face tax consequences and early withdrawal penalties.</p><p>The good news is that the interest you pay goes back into your account, and it’s usually set at 1% to 2% plus the prime rate — which is likely much lower than any other interest rate you’ll get, especially with bad credit.

Here are some of the most important things to take into account when considering your options.</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong> The annual percentage rate, or <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>, is a great way to compare loan options apples to apples. The APR accounts for both upfront fees and interest to show you the total cost of the loan, expressed on an annual basis.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> An <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is a common cost associated with a personal loan that is often deducted from the loan amount before it’s disbursed to you. Depending on the lender, an origination fee could be as high as 12%, but not all lenders charge them.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> A repayment term is <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">how long you have to repay the loan</a>. For hardship loans, this can vary widely, from 2 weeks for payday loans and cash advance apps, to multiple years for personal loans and 401(k) loans. Repayment terms are important because, generally speaking, the shorter the repayment term, the higher the monthly payment amount.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\"><strong>Amount</strong></a><strong>:</strong> It will be easier to qualify for a very small amount of money, like a sum under $500, as neither payday loan lenders nor cash advance apps typically consider your credit. Even if you qualify for a personal loan or other installment loan that runs your credit, you may still not qualify for a large amount if the lender doesn’t feel confident that you can repay it.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Credit score</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A low credit score can affect your borrowing options, putting many affordable loans out of reach. Loans like payday loans and title loans that don’t weigh your credit score are usually high-cost and high-risk borrowing options.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-do-personal-loans-work\">How Do Personal Loans Work?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:292098":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"292098","content":"<h2>How to get a hardship loan with bad credit</h2><p>If you have a low credit score, you’re not without options. Here are some things to consider when applying for loans:</p><ul><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> Putting up collateral (like your car) to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">secure a personal loan</a> can increase the amount you're eligible to borrow, lower the cost of the loan, or help you qualify. OneMain Financial, Upgrade, and Reprise are all recommended lenders that offer secured loans, but not all personal loan lenders do. If you miss payments, you could lose your collateral.</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner:</strong> A handful of lenders, like OneMain Financial, allow you to apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">loan with a cosigner</a>. A cosigner should be someone with a good credit profile who will take on responsibility for the loan with you — if you don't pay, they're on the hook.</li><li><strong>Apply with a joint applicant: </strong>If you'll be using the loan for joint needs, like a new appliance or home repair for you and your partner, it could help to apply for the loan together. This way, the lender will consider your joint applicant's income and credit as well as yours.</li><li><strong>Look for low credit score requirements:</strong> Some lenders offer loans to borrowers with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-credit-history-loans\">low or no credit </a>scores. Look for lenders with low minimum credit score requirements and prequalify with them before choosing a higher-risk option.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If a close friend or family member has good credit and is willing to make you an authorized user on their credit card, it could go a long way to improving your credit score. This, in turn, could help you qualify for a loan.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to hardship loans</h2><p>If you’re struggling to qualify for a personal loan or PAL and don’t want to take out a riskier loan, consider other options:</p><ul><li><strong>Grants and financial assistance:</strong> If you are struggling to make rent, pay for medical expenses, or afford basic necessities like food and utilities, you may be eligible for financial assistance. Use the search feature at <a href=\"https://www.211.org/about-us/your-local-211\">211.org</a> to see what’s available in your area.</li><li><strong>A family member or friend:</strong> If you have someone in your life who would be willing to help, it may be worth it to reach out. Come to a mutually agreeable repayment schedule with specific dates for when payments are due — and make a record of it for both of you to reference.</li><li><strong>401(k) $1,000 emergency withdrawal:</strong> If your plan allows, you can withdraw up to $1,000 for an emergency personal expense without penalty once per year. You’ll still need to pay income tax on the withdrawn amount, but can avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty that’s typically assessed if you’re under 59 ½.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\"><strong>Debt management plan</strong></a><strong> (DMP):</strong> Either as an alternative to or in conjunction with a hardship loan, a DMP through a credit counselor could lower your current monthly debt payments and/or save money on interest — potentially freeing up cash so that you don’t have to borrow.</li><li><strong>BNPL:</strong> If you need to borrow money to make a purchase, a buy now, pay later app may be a good option. BNPL apps like Affirm and Klarna have looser credit requirements than personal loans, and may only run a soft credit check when you apply. Interest and fees can be low or $0, especially if you choose a pay-in-4 plan over 6 weeks. But you typically will need to make the first installment upfront.</li></ul><h2>How to improve your credit</h2><p>Getting a loan is&nbsp;much easier if you don’t have bad credit. But it often takes time to improve your credit — which you may not have if you’re facing a hardship now. So in addition to tried and true ways of improving your credit long-term, we’ll cover a couple of quick-win ways to boost your score within a month.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quick credit boosters</h3><ul><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> As noted above, becoming an authorized user on the credit card of someone with good credit can improve your credit score. How? Because their credit card account — including payment history and available credit — is typically reported on&nbsp;your credit report once you become an authorized user. And most credit card companies report monthly, meaning you could see your score improve within one month.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a rent- and utility-reporting service:</strong> Services like Experian Boost report your on-time rent and other payments (like utilities and cell service) to one or more credit bureaus, which can increase your score almost instantly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ask for a credit line increase:</strong> If one or more of your credit card balances are high, but you’ve been making on-time payments, you may be able to request and be approved for a credit line increase. This can help reduce your credit utilization, and thereby increase your score once the new credit limit is reported (typically, within one month).</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:292110":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"292110","content":"<h3>Long-term credit gains</h3><ul><li><strong>Make payments on time: </strong>Since payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score, making payments on time is the single most important thing you can do to raise your score and keep it up.</li><li><strong>Keep credit utilization low:</strong> Since credit utilization — the amount of credit you’re using compared to the amount you have —&nbsp; contributes up to 30% to your score, keeping it low or reducing it can result in big credit score gains. In addition to quick-win ways of lowering credit utilization, work on paying down your credit card balances. Or better yet, don’t run them up in the first place.</li><li><strong>Get a credit builder loan:</strong> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">credit builder loan</a> works like a loan in reverse. Instead of getting all the money you borrow upfront, you receive it once the loan is paid in full. As a result, these types of loans are much easier to get approved for and can help your score since payments are reported to the credit bureaus.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get a secured credit card:</strong> Unlike a typical unsecured credit card, you’ll need to put down a security deposit to get a secured credit card.

This can be an ideal way to borrow a large sum of money without liquidating long-term investments while getting a lower rate <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\">compared to an unsecured loan</a>.</p><p>The type of loan and the amount of money you need depend on the brokerage. For example, TD Ameritrade offers a securities-backed credit line from $100,000 to $25 million, while Fidelity's line of credit typically must be secured by a minimum portfolio value of $500,000.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:258238":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"258238","content":"<h2>How to compare $200K personal loans</h2><p>Take the time to compare $200K loan options to lock down the best option for your finances.</p><h3>1. Interest rates and APRs</h3><p>The <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> of a personal loan accounts for both the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rate</a> and any upfront lender fees, which makes APRs a more accurate way to measure the cost of borrowing than interest rates alone. The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to display APRs for most types of consumer loans, so it's easy for borrowers to compare costs among different lenders.</p><p>If you're comparing two personal loans for the same amount — in this case, $200,000 — with the same repayment term, the loan with the lower APR should cost less.

Total repayment costs</h3><p>A $200,000 personal loan will end up costing you a lot more than $200,000, due to interest and fees. The higher the APR and fees, the more you'll spend in the long run.

If you're having trouble finding an <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\">unsecured personal loan</a> for $200,000, consider one of these alternatives, depending on your purpose for borrowing that much cash:</p><p>Keep in mind: One of the personal loan eligibility factors lenders consider is your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>. You may qualify for the initial $100,000 loan but struggle to secure a second because of the impact the first loan has on your DTI.</p><h3>Additional personal loans</h3><p>There's <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-many-personal-loans-can-you-have\">no limit to how many personal loans you can have</a> at a time. Theoretically, if you're having trouble finding (or qualifying for) a $200K loan, you could apply for two $100K personal loans, or four <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50K personal loans</a>, or use a combination of personal loans and credit cards.</p><h3>Home equity loan or line of credit</h3><p>If you own a home and have built up enough equity, you may be able to qualify for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC). This can be great for financing major home renovations or whole-house remodels.</p><p>However, to get a $200,000 home equity loan, you need to have more than $200,000 in home equity. Most lenders let you borrow up to 80% or 85% of <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">your home's equity</a>. So, if you want a $200K home equity loan, you'd ideally have at least $250,000 in equity.</p><p>“Another option might be a cash-out refinance,” says Chad Gammon, certified financial planner and owner of Custom Fit Financial. “This might be a good option if your property has appreciated since you purchased it.”</p><h3>Medical payment plan</h3><p>If you're trying to get $200K to cover extreme medical costs for you or a loved one, a personal loan is not your only path forward. Speak with the hospital about a medical payment plan, or try crowdfunding online and through friends, family, and your community to cover the bills.</p><h3>Debt relief solutions</h3><p>If you want the $200,000 to consolidate various debts, you might have trouble qualifying if your credit score is not in the best shape.</p><p>While we always recommend pursuing paths that won't severely lower your credit score, drowning in $200K or more of debt may be cause for looking into debt relief options, such as a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>, <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-settlement\">debt settlement</a>, or — as a last resort — <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-bankruptcy\">bankruptcy</a>.

A kitchen that feels bright, clean, and thoughtfully updated can compete with fully renovated ones. The key is avoiding over-customization and focusing on improvements that help buyers imagine themselves living there.”</p><h2>Types of loans for kitchen remodels</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312370":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312370","content":"<h3>Personal loan</h3><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">use a personal loan</a> for almost anything, including financing home renovations and even paying off debt you’ve already acquired for prior or ongoing renovations. Personal loans are typically unsecured, making them especially attractive if you don’t have or want to tap your home equity. Here are a few other reasons we like personal loans for kitchen renovations:</p><ul><li><strong>Lower rates than credit cards:</strong>&nbsp;The other unsecured go-to loan option is a credit card, especially if you already have one or more. But unless you qualify for a 0% APR promotion, credit card interest rates tend to be much higher than personal loan rates and available loan amounts smaller — making them a poor choice by comparison.</li><li><strong>Fixed interest rates:</strong> Unlike a HELOC or credit card, the interest rate and monthly payment are fixed (they won’t change) for the duration of the repayment term.</li><li><strong>Lump sum distribution:</strong> Once you’re approved, you’ll receive a lump sum deposited directly into your bank account to spend as needed on labor and materials.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You can get money fast:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re ready to start your project ASAP, you can find personal loans with same-day or next-day funding. Here are some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">best same-day loans</a> for kitchen remodels.</li><li><strong>They’re easier to qualify for:</strong>&nbsp;Borrowers with good to excellent credit can typically qualify for most personal loans. But you could even qualify for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\">personal loan with fair credit</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your house isn’t collateral:</strong>&nbsp;HELOCs and home equity loans require your home to serve as collateral, which can be dangerous if you default on the loan. Most personal loans, on the other hand, are unsecured, meaning you don’t have to offer collateral. In exchange, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">personal loan interest rates</a> tend to be higher.</li><li><strong>Wide range of loan amounts:</strong>&nbsp;Available loan amounts vary by lender, but in general, you can borrow between $2,000 to over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a> with a personal loan — especially if you’ll use the loan for home improvement (a.k.a., a kitchen remodel).</li><li><strong>Repayment terms are short:</strong>&nbsp;A personal loan isn’t a long-term commitment, relatively speaking. Most personal loans have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> up to 7 years, though some offer 10-year terms or longer. You could pay off your new kitchen years sooner than with a home equity loan or HELOC, which could also save you money.</li><li><strong>No prepayment penalties:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> typically don't charge prepayment penalties. That means you can pay off your personal loan early to save money on interest.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While personal loans have a lot going for them, if you’re covering a large kitchen remodel and have substantial equity, a tax-deductible home equity loan, HELOC, or cash-out refinance could provide a much larger loan amount at a lower interest rate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> lets you borrow against the equity you’ve built in your home. Much like personal loans, you can use home equity loans for a wide range of purposes, but home renovations, including kitchen remodels, are among the most common.</p><p>Also like personal loans, home equity loans involve a lump-sum loan amount at the start of the loan, and you’ll make payments in installments over a set number of years (often between five and 30 years).</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312374":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312374","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/home-equity-loan-heloc-requirements\">Home equity loan requirements</a> are stricter than some personal loans, and they also take longer to fund — sometimes a month or more. If you are itching to start renovations or are on a timeline to list your home, a personal loan might be the better option.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">Personal loans vs. home equity loans</a></p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC) is another way to tap into the equity you’ve built in your home in order to fund your kitchen remodel, usually at a lower interest rate than a personal loan. The key difference between a home equity loan and HELOC is that a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.</p><p>During a HELOC’s draw period (often five to 10 years), you can borrow money as needed, up to your limit. This gives you more flexibility to remodel your kitchen in stages, or even to tackle your kitchen first but also take on other renovation projects in the coming years. You’ll then make payments toward the principal balance during the repayment period (often up to 20 years), though interest-only payments begin during the draw period.</p><p>Another key distinction between home equity loans and HELOCs is how the interest works. Most home equity loans have fixed rates, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/heloc-variable-rate-history\">HELOC interest rates</a> are typically variable; this can make monthly payments more challenging to predict.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">Personal loan vs. HELOC</a></p><h3>Credit card</h3><p>High-interest credit cards shouldn’t be your first choice to fund a home renovation as expensive as a kitchen remodel, but don’t rule them out. If you qualify for a credit card that has a special 0% introductory rate for a set number of months, you could theoretically pay with plastic and then pay off your loan before the 0% intro rate expires.</p><p>A few caveats:</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong>&nbsp;Special 0% APR financing usually lasts no more than 12 to 18 months. Paying off an entire kitchen remodel in that time period can be challenging. If you don’t, the regular APR will kick in, and it could be high. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve</a>, the average APR for a credit card is more than 21%.</li><li><strong>Contractor acceptance:</strong>&nbsp;You may not be able to pay your contractor with a credit card. Ask your contractor if they accept credit card payments before signing an agreement; if they don’t, see if you can at least buy the materials on your own with a credit card.</li><li><strong>Qualifying:</strong>&nbsp;Credit cards, especially those with attractive promos, can be challenging to qualify for if you don’t have great credit.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312378":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312378","content":"<p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">Personal loan vs. 0% APR credit card</a></p><h3>Cash-out refinance</h3><p>Another way to leverage the equity in your home is to do a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a>. Instead of taking out a second mortgage (like a home equity loan), you refinance your mortgage for a higher amount than what you owe and pocket the extra cash. You can then use that extra money for whatever you want, like remodeling your kitchen. You can generally refinance up to 85-90% of the value of your home.</p><p>Keep in mind: This means you’re essentially starting over with a new mortgage, with new terms and a new interest rate. A cash-out refinance generally doesn’t make sense unless you can lock in a lower&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">mortgage rate</a> than what you started with.</p><p>That said, a cash-out refinance is a way to borrow money from your home&nbsp;without taking out a second loan, as you would with a home equity loan or HELOC.</p><h2>When to consider a kitchen remodel loan (and when to avoid it)</h2><p>A kitchen remodel loan can be your ticket to new cabinets, counters, flooring, lighting, and appliances, but it also makes the renovations more expensive after you account for fees and interest. So how do you know if you should take out a loan to remodel your kitchen?</p><h3>When to consider</h3><p>A kitchen remodel loan makes sense if:</p><ul><li><strong>You plan to sell your home soon:</strong>&nbsp;A kitchen remodel can be a great investment for sellers. Depending on the type of renovations, you could recoup as much as 113% of your costs when you sell your home. And if your current kitchen is outdated or not functional, a remodel could make a difference between selling your home the day you list it and letting it sit on the market for months and months. When you sell your home for a profit, use the proceeds to pay off the kitchen remodel loan before spending the money elsewhere.</li><li><strong>You have excellent credit:</strong>&nbsp;Borrowers with great or excellent credit will qualify for the lowest fees and interest rates on personal loans, home equity loans, and HELOCs. That makes borrowing to finance a kitchen remodel a little less expensive and easier to repay.</li><li><strong>You have a 0% APR rewards credit card:</strong>&nbsp;If you plan to DIY a kitchen remodel and can qualify for a credit card with temporary special financing, you might be able to pay for the whole renovation without spending a cent on interest — as long as you pay off the card before the special financing ends. Even better, if it’s a cash-back credit card, you may actually&nbsp;earn a little cash by paying with credit instead of another type of loan.</li><li><strong>You have cash on hand:</strong>&nbsp;It may seem counterintuitive to take out a loan when you have a hefty savings account. But keeping cash on hand in an emergency fund, for example, can prevent you from needing a loan out of desperation if the unexpected occurs. This is especially true if you can qualify for a very low interest rate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You itemize deductions on your taxes:</strong>&nbsp;One perk of using a home-equity based financing option is that you can generally deduct the interest on your tax return —&nbsp;as long as you itemize. This, in turn, can reduce your effective interest rate on the loan by reducing your taxes.</li></ul><h3>When to avoid</h3><p>Although kitchen remodels offer a great return on investment, it doesn’t always make sense to get one to pay for a kitchen remodel. Here’s when to avoid a kitchen remodel loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Your budget is tight:</strong>&nbsp;If you already live paycheck to paycheck (or close to it), adding another loan payment to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">monthly budget</a> might be impractical, at best. This is especially dangerous if you’re using your home as collateral for the loan.</li><li><strong>You don’t have an emergency fund:</strong>&nbsp;As a homeowner, it’s crucial to build an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a> to pay for unexpected home repairs or cover your mortgage payments if you ever lose your job. Focus on establishing and growing your emergency fund before taking on debt for home renovation projects.</li><li><strong>The renovations don’t have a high ROI:</strong>&nbsp;Not every kitchen remodeling project has the same return on investment. If you’re focused on a high-value project, like replacing cabinets or increasing countertop space, it may be worth the effort, but changes that offer less ROI, such as choosing expensive countertop materials or luxury appliances, may not be worth going into debt for.</li></ul><h2>How much do kitchen remodels cost?</h2><p>On average, a kitchen remodel costs between $14,600 and $41,500, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.angi.com/articles/how-much-should-kitchen-remodel-cost.htm\">Angi</a> (formerly Angie’s List), a home services platform with extensive cost guides for home renovations. On the low end, a remodel might cost as little as $10,000, but for major, high-end remodels, you might spend $130,000 or more. These costs depend on several factors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>The extent of the remodel:</strong>&nbsp;Small projects, like installing a backsplash or replacing the oven, are much more affordable than complete remodels that include new cabinets, countertops, appliances, flooring, plumbing, and light fixtures.</li><li><strong>Who does the work:</strong>&nbsp;Homeowners with the tools, time, and patience can save a lot of money doing some or all of the work themselves. According to Angi, professional labor often accounts for 25% of the overall kitchen remodeling cost.</li><li><strong>Quality of the materials:</strong>&nbsp;You can spring for luxurious materials, from high-end cabinetry and marble countertops to hardwood flooring and state-of-the-art appliances, but this will drive your costs up significantly.</li><li><strong>Where you live:</strong>&nbsp;Your city’s cost of living has a real impact on both material and labor costs.</li><li><strong>Financing costs:</strong>&nbsp;As we’ve seen, kitchen remodel loans aren’t free. You’ll need to budget for any fees and interest for financing.</li></ul><h3>How to save money on a kitchen remodel</h3><p>There are several ways to save money on kitchen remodels, from rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself to setting your sights on only a few key updates.</p><p>“Choose your materials carefully,” advises Angie Hicks, co-founder and chief customer officer of Angi. “While you can’t do much to sway the cost of labor in your area, you can choose materials that are more affordable, or at least more buyer-friendly. If you’re planning on selling your house soon, be sure to choose materials that are neutral and that buyers would find desirable.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312382":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312382","content":"<p>“Start with updating — repainting or refinishing — cabinets and updating hardware,” Romelli adds. “You certainly don’t always need a full renovation. A kitchen that feels intentional, functional, and, most importantly, well cared for can really make an emotional impact on buyers.”</p><p>Romelli also warns of a common mistake: doing a rush job thinking that any update, no matter the quality, is a good thing.</p><p>“The biggest mistake is doing quick, cheap fixes, like low-quality laminate counters, mismatched appliances, or rushed paint jobs,” she says. “I would rather see less done by a seller at a lower home price point that would allow a buyer to have the budget to make their own personal choices.”</p><h2>ROI of common kitchen improvements</h2><p>On the whole, kitchen remodels have a sizable return on investment. If you’re looking to put money into your home before listing — and you’ve already taken care of big things that won’t pass inspection, like an old and leaking roof — prioritize your kitchen. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jlconline.com/cost-vs-value/2024/\">Journal of Light Construction</a>:</p><ul><li>Minor, midrange kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>113%</strong>.</li><li>Major, midrange kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>51%</strong>.</li><li>Major, upscale kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>36%</strong>.</li></ul><p>This data shows that tackling smaller projects to make your kitchen warmer and more functional, without going all-out on high-end upgrades, typically yields the highest return on investment. This tracks with Romelli’s client experiences.</p><p>“I’ve had clients make very modest updates that created a dramatic shift in buyer interest,” Romelli explains. “A seller with an older home already had&nbsp;very clean and well-maintained appliances, but he had his cabinets re-stained, updated the hardware, and added a little bit of new lighting and replaced the outlet covers. The changes weren’t expensive, but they were totally striking!”</p><p>She adds, “Another seller simply deep-cleaned the space, decluttered, and replaced the faucet. The seller opted to have a few rooms staged, including the kitchen, and buyers commented that the home felt cared for.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312386":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312386","content":"<p>The table below breaks down the return on investment of various kitchen remodel projects.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312390":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312390","content":"<h2>Other ways to fund a kitchen remodel</h2><p>Taking out a kitchen remodel loan won’t work for everybody. If taking out a personal loan or borrowing against your equity isn’t a good path for you, here are other options to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Savings account:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re a savvy saver, this could be a great, interest-free way to pay for a kitchen remodel. Focus on saving for several months, until you have enough cash to cover the cost of the kitchen remodel. That said, don’t drain your emergency savings to pay for home renovations; that money is for real emergencies.</li><li><strong>Securities-based line of credit or 401(k) loan:</strong>&nbsp;If you’ve got a lot of money locked up in investments, such as stocks, you might be able to borrow against your portfolio with a securities-based line of credit. This lets you keep your money invested but still pay for your new kitchen. Similarly, you can borrow against your retirement savings with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/401k-loan\">401(k) loan</a>. Talk with a financial advisor before making either decision.</li><li><strong>Contractor financing:</strong>&nbsp;Some general contractors may offer in-house financing for big kitchen remodels. It’s worth exploring, but you should always compare their rates and terms against other types of financing, like personal loans, to see where you can get a better deal.</li><li><strong>DIY in stages:</strong>&nbsp;If you are in no rush and handy around the house, you can tackle the projects on your own (or with some friends) as you have the time and money. Just keep in mind: Poor craftsmanship can ultimately hurt you when you sell your house, so make sure you can do a good job before committing to a DIY approach.</li></ul><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best kitchen remodel loans.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

And, secured personal loans are available.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

It’s worth considering a personal loan through Splash if you have good credit (ideally, a FICO score above Splash's minimum requirement of 680). The platform offers loans from a wide range of lenders, and next-day funding is available. Loans are available up to $100,000 if you apply via Splash’s website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are competitive, but borrowers with excellent credit may find lower APRs elsewhere.

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Common loan types for remodeling your kitchen include <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loans</a>, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, a credit card, or a cash-out refinance.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Even with financing costs, such as an <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../mortgage/origination-fees.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">origination fee</a> and monthly interest, a kitchen remodel loan can be advantageous. A kitchen remodel can boost your home’s value significantly, depending on the scale of the project, and could help you sell your home faster and for more money.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">“Kitchens have one of the strongest emotional impacts on buyers, but you don’t need a full renovation to see value,” says Diane Romelli, a Cincinnati-based Realtor with Sibcy Cline. “Small updates can carry impressive ROI. A kitchen that feels bright, clean, and thoughtfully updated can compete with fully renovated ones. The key is avoiding over-customization and focusing on improvements that help buyers imagine themselves living there.”</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="types-of-loans-for-kitchen-remodels">Types of loans for kitchen remodels</h2></section><div class="mb-32"><div class="styles_tableContainer__Twqrz"><table class="styles_table__sCSsc"><thead><tr><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Type of kitchen remodel loan</strong></section></div></th><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Best for</strong></section></div></th><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tax-deductible interest</strong></section></div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=""><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Personal loan</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Fast funding; small projects; fair to good credit</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">No</section></div></td></tr><tr class="styles_odd__qt0G5"><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Home equity loan</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Moderate to large renovations, all at one time</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Yes</section></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">HELOC</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Ongoing renovations over several years</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Yes</section></div></td></tr><tr class="styles_odd__qt0G5"><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Credit card</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Smaller projects that can be repaid quickly</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">No</section></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Cash-out refinance</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Borrowers who want a fresh kitchen and a lower mortgage rate</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Yes</section></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Personal loan</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You can <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../what-are-personal-loans-used-for.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">use a personal loan</a> for almost anything, including financing home renovations and even paying off debt you’ve already acquired for prior or ongoing renovations. Personal loans are typically unsecured, making them especially attractive if you don’t have or want to tap your home equity. Here are a few other reasons we like personal loans for kitchen renovations:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Lower rates than credit cards:</strong> The other unsecured go-to loan option is a credit card, especially if you already have one or more. But unless you qualify for a 0% APR promotion, credit card interest rates tend to be much higher than personal loan rates and available loan amounts smaller — making them a poor choice by comparison.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Fixed interest rates:</strong> Unlike a HELOC or credit card, the interest rate and monthly payment are fixed (they won’t change) for the duration of the repayment term.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Lump sum distribution:</strong> Once you’re approved, you’ll receive a lump sum deposited directly into your bank account to spend as needed on labor and materials. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You can get money fast:</strong> If you’re ready to start your project ASAP, you can find personal loans with same-day or next-day funding. Here are some of the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../same-day-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">best same-day loans</a> for kitchen remodels.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">They’re easier to qualify for:</strong> Borrowers with good to excellent credit can typically qualify for most personal loans. But you could even qualify for a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../best-personal-loans-fair-credit.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan with fair credit</a>. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Your house isn’t collateral:</strong> HELOCs and home equity loans require your home to serve as collateral, which can be dangerous if you default on the loan. Most personal loans, on the other hand, are unsecured, meaning you don’t have to offer collateral. In exchange, however, <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan-interest-rates.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan interest rates</a> tend to be higher.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Wide range of loan amounts:</strong> Available loan amounts vary by lender, but in general, you can borrow between $2,000 to over <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../100k-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">$100,000</a> with a personal loan — especially if you’ll use the loan for home improvement (a.k.a., a kitchen remodel).</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms are short:</strong> A personal loan isn’t a long-term commitment, relatively speaking. Most personal loans have <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan-term-length.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">repayment terms</a> up to 7 years, though some offer 10-year terms or longer. You could pay off your new kitchen years sooner than with a home equity loan or HELOC, which could also save you money.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">No prepayment penalties:</strong> <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Personal loans</a> typically don&#x27;t charge prepayment penalties. That means you can pay off your personal loan early to save money on interest. </li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">While personal loans have a lot going for them, if you’re covering a large kitchen remodel and have substantial equity, a tax-deductible home equity loan, HELOC, or cash-out refinance could provide a much larger loan amount at a lower interest rate. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Home equity loan</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">home equity loan</a> lets you borrow against the equity you’ve built in your home.

The key difference between a home equity loan and HELOC is that a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">During a HELOC’s draw period (often five to 10 years), you can borrow money as needed, up to your limit. This gives you more flexibility to remodel your kitchen in stages, or even to tackle your kitchen first but also take on other renovation projects in the coming years. You’ll then make payments toward the principal balance during the repayment period (often up to 20 years), though interest-only payments begin during the draw period.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Another key distinction between home equity loans and HELOCs is how the interest works. Most home equity loans have fixed rates, while <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../mortgage/heloc-variable-rate-history.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">HELOC interest rates</a> are typically variable; this can make monthly payments more challenging to predict.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Read more:</strong> <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../heloc-vs-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Personal loan vs. HELOC</a></p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Credit card</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">High-interest credit cards shouldn’t be your first choice to fund a home renovation as expensive as a kitchen remodel, but don’t rule them out. If you qualify for a credit card that has a special 0% introductory rate for a set number of months, you could theoretically pay with plastic and then pay off your loan before the 0% intro rate expires.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A few caveats:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">APR:</strong> Special 0% APR financing usually lasts no more than 12 to 18 months.

Depending on the type of renovations, you could recoup as much as 113% of your costs when you sell your home. And if your current kitchen is outdated or not functional, a remodel could make a difference between selling your home the day you list it and letting it sit on the market for months and months. When you sell your home for a profit, use the proceeds to pay off the kitchen remodel loan before spending the money elsewhere.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You have excellent credit:</strong> Borrowers with great or excellent credit will qualify for the lowest fees and interest rates on personal loans, home equity loans, and HELOCs. That makes borrowing to finance a kitchen remodel a little less expensive and easier to repay.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You have a 0% APR rewards credit card:</strong> If you plan to DIY a kitchen remodel and can qualify for a credit card with temporary special financing, you might be able to pay for the whole renovation without spending a cent on interest — as long as you pay off the card before the special financing ends. Even better, if it’s a cash-back credit card, you may actually earn a little cash by paying with credit instead of another type of loan.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You have cash on hand:</strong> It may seem counterintuitive to take out a loan when you have a hefty savings account. But keeping cash on hand in an emergency fund, for example, can prevent you from needing a loan out of desperation if the unexpected occurs. This is especially true if you can qualify for a very low interest rate. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You itemize deductions on your taxes:</strong> One perk of using a home-equity based financing option is that you can generally deduct the interest on your tax return — as long as you itemize. This, in turn, can reduce your effective interest rate on the loan by reducing your taxes.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">When to avoid</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Although kitchen remodels offer a great return on investment, it doesn’t always make sense to get one to pay for a kitchen remodel.

The changes weren’t expensive, but they were totally striking!”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">She adds, “Another seller simply deep-cleaned the space, decluttered, and replaced the faucet.

When you sell your home for a profit, use the proceeds to pay off the kitchen remodel loan before spending the money elsewhere.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have excellent credit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Borrowers with great or excellent credit will qualify for the lowest fees and interest rates on personal loans, home equity loans, and HELOCs. That makes borrowing to finance a kitchen remodel a little less expensive and easier to repay.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have a 0% APR rewards credit card:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;If you plan to DIY a kitchen remodel and can qualify for a credit card with temporary special financing, you might be able to pay for the whole renovation without spending a cent on interest — as long as you pay off the card before the special financing ends. Even better, if it’s a cash-back credit card, you may actually\u0026nbsp;earn a little cash by paying with credit instead of another type of loan.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have cash on hand:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;It may seem counterintuitive to take out a loan when you have a hefty savings account. But keeping cash on hand in an emergency fund, for example, can prevent you from needing a loan out of desperation if the unexpected occurs. This is especially true if you can qualify for a very low interest rate.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou itemize deductions on your taxes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;One perk of using a home-equity based financing option is that you can generally deduct the interest on your tax return —\u0026nbsp;as long as you itemize.
