Before deciding, consider the loan's potential APR, repayment terms, and how it fits into your financial goals. Be sure only to borrow the amount you need to keep your payments and total costs manageable.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it hard to get a $50K personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Requirements for a $50K personal loan vary by lender, with some having stricter requirements than others. Generally, a good to excellent credit score and steady income can make it easier to get approved for a $50,000 loan. Consider prequalifying with multiple lenders to see whether you might be approved and your potential rate. Keep in mind that a lender won't make an official decision until you apply.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a personal loan affect your credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>When you apply for a $50,000 personal loan, the lender conducts a hard credit check, which can temporarily reduce your credit score by a few points. You'll also lower the average age of your credit, which could negatively impact your credit score.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, adding an <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a> to your credit report could slightly improve your score if you mostly have revolving accounts, like a line of credit or credit cards. If you're using the loan to pay off credit cards, you could see a significant increase in your score since your credit utilization will decrease.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long will it take to pay off a $50K loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You can often choose which payment period you prefer from among the terms the lender offers. Many lenders have repayment terms of up to five or seven years for $50,000 personal loans. LightStream offers up to 12-year repayment terms on some $50,000 loans, which is uncommon.</p>"}}]}

With a lower starting rate of 6.49%, LightStream may be a better deal for borrowers with excellent credit. SoFi rates start at 8.99%, but you’d need to enroll in autopay and set up direct deposit with a SoFi bank account to qualify for the lowest APR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Minimum credit score</h3><p>LightStream only accepts applicants with good or excellent credit. SoFi doesn’t publish a minimum credit score, but poor and fair credit borrowers may have <a href=\"/personal-loan/denied-personal-loan\">difficulty getting approved</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan purpose</h3><p>Both SoFi and LightStream allow borrowers to use the loan funds for most personal and household expenses. <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-cant-you-use-a-personal-loan-for\">Restricted loan uses</a> include college educational expenses, business expenses, and investments. SoFi additionally prohibits you from using the funds for real estate purposes, while LightStream allows you to use a personal loan to purchase a timeshare.&nbsp;</p><p>However, LightStream stands out if you need to finance home improvements, given the longer repayment term options, and SoFi might work better for&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">debt consolidation</a> because the bank provides a discount if you have the funds sent directly to your creditors. Note that SoFi loans through Credible are only available for consolidating debt and/or refinancing credit cards.&nbsp;</p><h3>Repayment terms</h3><p>SoFi and LightStream both offer a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">range of repayment terms</a>, with options from two to seven years for most loan types, but LightStream offers long repayment terms up to 20 years for home improvement loans. If you’re planning to use the loan for a home renovation project, LightStream offers more flexibility than SoFi and lower rates.</p><h3>Loan amount</h3><p>LightStream and SoFi offer an identical <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">range of loan amounts</a> — from $5,000 to $100,000. Depending on your financial profile, however, you may qualify for a larger amount with one lender than the other. If you’re looking for a loan for less than $5,000, consider lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-small-loan\">small personal loans</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Time to fund</h3><p>LightStream and SoFi offer funding as soon as the same business day, but loans from either lender took several days to fund based on 12 months of Credible personal loan marketplace data. Other lenders like Discover, Upgrade, and Upstart funded loans in two days, on average.&nbsp;</p><p>SoFi disburses funds via ACH transfer the same day you’re approved, provided you sign your loan documents before 6 p.m. ET on a business day. LightStream offers same-day wire transfers, but you’ll need to log in by 2:30 p.m. ET on a business day to get your cash that day. Depending on where you bank, you may also have to pay a wire transfer fee.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">Best Same-Day Loans</a></p><h2>How to apply for a personal loan</h2><p>LightStream and SoFi have slightly different personal loan application processes. Generally speaking, here’s what you can expect.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Check your credit:</strong>&nbsp;Before applying with any lender, check your credit score to ensure you meet the lender’s minimum credit score requirement. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">check your credit score for free</a> using Credible's credit-monitoring tool. SoFi doesn’t disclose a minimum credit score requirement, but LightStream requires a minimum 700 FICO credit score if applying through Credible.</li><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong>&nbsp;Use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-credible-personal-loan\">personal loan marketplace</a> to qualify with LightStream, SoFi, and other lenders to get an estimate of the APR and loan terms you might be approved for. SoFi allows you to prequalify directly on its website with no credit impact. LightStream does not. When comparing your options, pay attention to the monthly payment and total interest in addition to the APR.</li><li><strong>Formally apply:</strong>&nbsp;Once you’ve compared loan quotes and made a choice, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply on the lender’s website</a> or follow the next steps to apply outlined after the prequalification process. You’ll need to provide info about your employment, income, and assets. Since formally applying typically requires a&nbsp;hard credit inquiry, you should limit the number of applications to minimize the damage to your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sign your loan documents:</strong>&nbsp;If approved, the lender will send a formal loan offer. Read the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, and ensure the final rate and monthly payment work for you. Then, e-sign the documents.</li><li><strong>Get the money:</strong>&nbsp;If you want a same-day wire transfer from LightStream, you’ll need to log in to your account and request the transfer in time. SoFi will transfer funds via ACH automatically, so you can sit back and wait for the money to arrive in your account. In either case, the exact timeline for receiving the funds will depend on your application, when you sign, and where you bank.&nbsp;</li></ol>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:281902":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"281902","content":"<h2>Which lender is best for you?</h2><h3>Best for home improvement loans: LightStream</h3><p>LightStream offers large loan amounts up to $100,000, APRs as low as 6.99%, and repayment terms up to 20 years for its home improvement loans. While not all applicants will have access to the full range of loan amounts and term lengths, LightStream offers the potential for a longer repayment term and lower monthly payment than any other personal loan lender, making LightStream an ideal choice for home renovation expenses.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for debt consolidation: SoFi</h3><p>SoFi can pay your credit card issuers on your behalf, and the bank offers a rate discount for choosing this option. SoFi also offers financial resources like no-cost advice from a financial planner and a highly rated mobile app with free budgeting tools and personalized financial insights. If you <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">struggle with budgeting</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management</a>, these can help ensure you don’t rack up more credit card debt. And if paying down your credit card balances improves your credit score, you may qualify to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-refinance-a-personal-loan\">refinance your personal loan</a> with SoFi to earn a lower rate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lowest rates: LightStream</h3><p>LightStream really shines when it comes to rates. For excellent credit borrowers, its rates were 3.04 percentage points lower than SoFi's, on average, according to 12 months of Credible personal loans data. Its rates for very good credit borrowers were over two percentage points lower, while good credit borrowers received rates almost three percentage points lower, on average.&nbsp;</p><p>With a high income and good or better credit score, you may find that a personal loan from LightStream is less costly — potentially much less costly if you’re getting a large loan. Plus, LightStream doesn’t charge any fees (even optional ones).&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for customer experience: Tie</h3><p>SoFi offers an array of member benefits and robust digital tools for managing your loan. If you’re interested in SoFi’s other financial products, you’ll enjoy the convenience of managing your accounts in one place. Unlike LightStream, SoFi provides several customer service options, including phone support and live chat support (you’ll need to log in to access live chat).&nbsp;</p><p>However, LightStream received higher marks for customer satisfaction from J.D.

As a result, if you’re approved for a loan with bad credit, you’re likely to be offered an annual percentage rate (<a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>) over 30%.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are bad credit loans and how do they work?</h2><p>A bad credit loan is any loan that you can potentially qualify for with bad credit. In this article, we focus on bad credit personal loans, which are a type of long-term installment loan. But many bad credit loans are short-term, high-fee loans that don’t require a credit check. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:</p><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><strong>Personal loans for bad credit</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These loans have APRs that top out at 36%; average rates for borrowers with bad credit are around 32% APR, but depend on the loan term you choose, your specific score, your income, current debt, and loan purpose. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">Loan amounts</a> range from around $1,000 to $50,000, with repayment terms typically between 2 and 7 years. They often require a credit check and report to one or more of the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> PALs are available from federal credit unions; loan amounts are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms of up to 1 year. APRs are capped at 28%, making them an excellent option if you need a $2,000 loan or less and are (or can become) a member of a participating credit union. Many credit unions will not check your credit for a PAL.</li><li><strong>Small bank loans:</strong> Some banks, like Bank of America and <a href=\"/personal-loan/us-bank-personal-loans-review\">U.S. Bank</a>, offer small loans up to $500 or $1,000 to existing customers. These may have a short repayment period, such as 3 months, during which you’d pay the loan back in equal installments. Fees tend to be relatively low, and a credit check may not be required.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Use with caution</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Cash apps review your banking history to assess how much you’re eligible to borrow, though loan amounts are usually well under $1,000. Repayment is typically deducted from your checking account on your next payday. Though they may have no mandatory fees, cash advance apps tend to charge same-day funding fees and “optional” tips. Both can lead to triple-digit APRs — 367%, on average, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\"><strong>401(k) loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If your plan allows them, you may be able to borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Repayment terms are 5 years. There’s no credit check (it’s your money), and the interest you pay is low and goes into your account. However, you could lose out on years of market gains. And if you leave your job before the loan is paid back, it becomes due, in full, immediately. If you can’t pay it back, it’s treated as a distribution subject to income tax and an early withdrawal penalty.</li></ul><h3>Avoid</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Payday loans often get a bad rap — and for good reason. The typical payday loan has an APR of almost 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Like cash advance apps, this is due to the combination of high fees, small loan amounts, and very short repayment terms.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\"><strong>Title loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A title loan is a secured loan where your vehicle's title is collateral. You can typically borrow a percentage of your car’s value, but if you fail to repay the loan, the lender can repossess your car. These loans often have very high interest rates and fees, making them a risky borrowing option.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\"><strong>Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A pawnshop loan is a short-term, secured loan where you borrow money by offering a valuable item as collateral. The pawnshop holds your item until you repay the loan with interest and fees — the amount of which could make the cost of borrowing equivalent to a triple-digit APR. If you fail to repay the loan, the pawnshop keeps the item and can sell it. The loan amount is typically a fraction of the item's value.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/what-is-a-bad-credit-personal-loan\">What Is a Bad Credit Loan?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289814":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289814","content":"<h2>How does credit affect your personal loan rate?</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">Your credit score</a> plays a major role in determining the APR you qualify for when you apply for a personal loan.

Five or 10 points either way could mean the difference between qualifying and not qualifying.</li><li><strong>Find lenders with low credit score requirements:</strong> The first and most important step is to find lenders that offer loans to borrowers with a 550 credit score. You can often find minimum credit score requirements on the lender's websites in their FAQ. You can also use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-credible-personal-loan\">personal loan marketplace</a> (like Credible) to compare minimum credit score requirements.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Prequalify</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Next, try to prequalify with multiple lenders to get a sense of which might approve your loan. Prequalification also estimates your rate, upfront fees, and how much you might be approved to borrow. Just note it’s not an offer of credit and the rates and terms of a loan offer may differ from prequalified quotes.</li><li><strong>Compare quotes:</strong> If you were able to prequalify (meaning, one or more lenders provided you with loan quotes), compare them to see which looks best. Consider each quote’s APR, whether an <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is charged and how much, the loan amount, length of the repayment term, and monthly payment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compare lenders you prequalified with:</strong> Consider customer reviews on sites like Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau, as well as <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">funding times</a> between lenders and whether each charges other fees, like late fees. Make sure the lender reports payments to the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Apply</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you’ve decided a personal loan is the way to go, apply with the lender that provided the best loan quote. Be ready to provide documentation, like pay stubs, to support your income and employment, plus a government ID. At this stage, most lenders perform a hard credit check, which could ding your score by up to 10 points for up to 1 year.</li><li><strong>Review the loan agreement:</strong> If approved, review the loan agreement before signing. Make sure the loan amount, repayment schedule, upfront fees, and APR are as expected.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Await funds:</strong> Once you’ve signed the agreement and other documents, the lender will send funds — either directly to your bank account or to your creditors (often an option if you’re getting a debt consolidation loan).&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/how-to-get-a-bad-credit-loan\">How to Get a Bad Credit Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289838":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289838","content":"<h2>How to improve your credit score</h2><p>One of the best ways to get a loan with bad credit is to improve your credit score. The best way for long-lasting gains is to make your monthly payments on time and keep credit card balances low.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Consistently pay bills on time:</strong> Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, the most of any single factor. Set up automatic payments for recurring bills like car payments, credit cards, and personal loans.

The account would be entered on your <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-report\">credit report</a>, which means their history of positive payments and available credit would be as well. Both can significantly boost your credit score.</li><li><strong>Don’t close credit card accounts:</strong> Closing old credit card accounts with a zero balance may seem like a good idea, but it can drastically increase your credit utilization, which can hurt your credit. <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-credit-utilization\">Credit utilization</a> represents the amount of revolving credit you’re using relative to the amount available to you. Keeping accounts open once you’ve paid off balances can be a good way to keep your credit utilization ratio low and improve your score.</li><li><strong>Avoid hard inquiries:</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard inquiry</a> often occurs when you formally apply for a loan.

Repayment is deducted from your bank account when your next paycheck is deposited. Payday loans have been widely criticized by lawmakers and consumer advocates because of exploitative costs and lending practices&nbsp;— APRs commonly range up to and over 400%, depending on your state.

Whether that's paying a vet bill, paying rent, buying groceries, or getting a needed car repair, a same-day loan can help you cover a range of unexpected or emergency expenses.</p><p>There can be some restrictions on what you can use the funds for, however, depending on the type of loan. For instance, when you apply for a personal loan, you need to tell the lender how you intend to use it, and may be obligated to use the funds for that purpose only. You also aren't generally allowed to borrow money for illegal activities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're concerned about restrictions, talk to the lender before applying.</p><h2>How to compare loans</h2><p>Given that there are different types of same-day loans and different purposes for getting one, there are a few factors to consider when deciding between them.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:288334":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"288334","content":"<p>The most important feature to compare between same-day loans — aside from how quickly the lender can make the funds available — is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is a measure of how much the loan costs on an annual basis, accounting for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees. This is important because some zero-interest or no-interest loans charge steep fees relative to the amount borrowed and the timeline for repayment, which can make them much more expensive and difficult to repay than an interest-charging personal loan.</p><p>For example, you might borrow $250 via a cash app and have the money deposited into your account instantly. But since most cash apps charge instant transfer fees or fees to expedite delivery, you’d need to account for that in the total cost of the loan. A regular personal loan calculator won’t get you there, but you can use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> or another calculator for short-term loans to figure out the APR.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Amount borrowed:</strong> $250</li><li><strong>Instant transfer fee:</strong> $5.99</li><li><strong>Payment due in two weeks</strong></li><li><strong>APR:</strong> 62.5%</li><li><strong>APR with $5 tip:</strong> 114.6%</li></ul><p>The 62.5% APR associated with the cash advance above makes this an expensive way to borrow&nbsp;— it’s even more expensive if you add a tip.

Note the lender’s same-day funding cutoff time.</li><li><strong>Complete the application early:</strong> You’ll <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete your application</a> directly on the lender's website. Do this as early as is feasible so you can get money today.

It's an additional amount you pay a lender in exchange for being able to borrow funds.</p><p>For both federal and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>, interest is calculated based on a percentage of the total loan balance.</p><h2>How does student loan interest accrue?</h2><p>The interest on a student loan is expressed as an annual rate. Generally, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/types-of-student-loans\">federal and private student loans</a> charge simple interest, which is calculated on the original amount you borrowed.</p><p>For example, let's say you borrowed $30,000, and your loan's interest rate is 6.53% per year. If your balance remained the same, you would <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/interest-start\">accrue</a> $1,959 of interest over the first year ($30,000 x 0.0653). However, the interest on student loans is usually calculated daily based on your current balance. That means as you make regular payments that reduce your principal, the amount of interest you accrue each day also gets progressively smaller.</p><p>Each of your payments will first go toward paying down the interest you owe for that month, with the remainder going toward the principal balance. With each payment you make, the amount applied to the principal increases, while the portion that goes toward interest decreases.</p><p>Missing monthly payments on a student loan can be very costly. The unpaid interest <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">capitalizes</a>, meaning it's added to the principal amount of the loan. This increases the amount on which the interest is calculated, meaning you're paying interest on top of that interest.</p><h2>Federal vs. private student loan interest rates</h2><p>Another major factor impacting how student loan interest is calculated is whether a loan's interest rate is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fixed-or-variable-rate\">fixed or variable</a>.</p><p>With a fixed interest rate, the rate remains the same for the life of the loan. But when a loan's interest rate is variable, the rate can change based on market conditions. It may go down, but it can also go up.</p><p>All federal student loans have fixed interest rates, which makes it easier to predict your loan costs well into the future. Private student loans, on the other hand, can have either fixed or variable interest rates. Variable rates can appear lower when comparing both options, but there's always the chance they could rise, bringing up the cost of monthly payments as well.</p><p>Another thing to consider with regard to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/types-of-student-loans\">federal vs. private student loans</a> is that while federal loans charge simple interest as opposed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">compound interest</a>, that might not always be the case with private loans.</p><p>“Most of your private loans stick with that simple interest model, but it's impossible to speak to every private loan out there,” says Brandon Barfield, director and co-founder of Student Loan Professor, and a former financial aid supervisor at Kaplan University.</p><h2>How to reduce the amount of interest you pay</h2><p>If you're worried about just how much interest charges can drive up the amount you ultimately repay on your loan, know that there are ways to minimize them. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Make interest payments while in school:</strong> With the exception of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">subsidized federal loans</a>, interest generally starts to accrue on student loans as soon as they are disbursed — even while you're still in school. By making interest-only payments during that time, you can cut down on the amount of interest that gets added to your loan, potentially saving you significantly in the long run.</li><li><strong>Pay extra toward the principal to lower total interest costs: </strong>Another way to save on interest is to put extra money toward <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans\">paying down your loan's principal</a>. This way, your loan's interest charges are lower since they're calculated on a lower principal balance.</li><li><strong>Refinance for a lower interest rate:</strong> You can also pay less in interest if you secure a lower interest rate than you currently have. If your credit score and other financial factors have improved since you first took out your loan, you may be able to land a more competitive rate through <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">student loan refinancing</a>.</li><li><strong>Shorten your repayment timeline: </strong>Another simple way to reduce the amount of interest you pay is to opt for a shorter repayment term. “If you look at amortization tables for how much you'd pay under a 20-year versus a 5- or 10-year loan, a longer-term loan has a lot more interest built into it,” says Barfield. “A 25-year plan will usually cost you double what you borrowed to get that degree,” he notes, whereas “with a 10-year standard payment plan, interest is usually half of what was borrowed in total payments.”</li></ul>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:14030":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"14030","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:287950":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"287950","content":"<h2>What happens if you don't pay student loan interest?</h2><p>While in school, you generally don't need to make payments on your student loans (though some private lenders require immediate repayment).

Here are several strategies to consider.</p><h3>Use the avalanche vs. snowball method</h3><ul><li><strong>Avalanche method:</strong> This method prioritizes paying off your highest-interest loan first while making the minimum payment on your other loans. Once that loan is repaid, you move on to the next high-interest loan.</li><li><strong>Snowball method:</strong> You prioritize your smallest loan first while paying the minimum on your other loans, and then move on to your next smallest.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, this schedule results in 26 half-payments, which adds up to 13 full payments instead of 12. That extra payment each year goes directly toward your principal balance, shaving interest that accrues over time.</p><h3>Use windfalls to cut your balance faster</h3><p>A windfall is any unexpected or irregular sum of money, such as a tax refund, work bonus, or inheritance. Maguire says this approach can work well for borrowers who don't want to bother with extra monthly payments.</p><p>“You can even start a student loan savings account and plan a lump-sum payment quarterly or annually,” recommends Maguire.</p><p>Whichever approach you choose, confirm with your loan servicer that the extra payment is applied to your loan principal rather than toward a future bill. This ensures you actually reduce your balance and save on interest.</p><h3>Budgeting and income tracking</h3><p>Tracking your spending and sticking to a budget can help you find expenses to cut and redirect more money toward student loan payments. However, be careful not to sacrifice your retirement savings in the process.</p><p>“Contributing to your qualified retirement accounts reduces your AGI,” explains Paulson.</p><p>Lowering your adjusted gross income (AGI) has two benefits: It can reduce the amount of taxes you owe, and if you're on an income-driven repayment plan, it can also lower your monthly student loan payment since those plans are based on your income.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-or-invest\">Should You Pay Off Student Loans or Invest?</a></p><h2>Example payoff timelines for $200K in loans</h2><p>Here's a sample of three payoff strategies, ranging from a standard 10-year plan to an aggressive monthly payment.

The buyer — and sometimes seller — must pay them when transferring ownership of real estate property, usually at closing time. Closing costs don’t include the down payment, but they may include home appraisal, title insurance fees, and other items.</p><p>“Closing costs are one of the main financial impacts of the homebuying process,” says Ashley DeHart, a REALTOR® at Realty from DeHart. “They include: title/escrow fees, loan fees, any seller credits, appraisal fees, title insurance, REALTOR® commissions, taxes, insurance, and filing fees. Many of these costs are flat fees that aren't negotiable.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:204194":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"204194","content":"<p>If you’re <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage\">getting a mortgage</a>, your lender must provide you with a closing disclosure at least three business days before the scheduled closing date. This document should list all closing fees. It should also include any relevant details about your mortgage, such as the interest rate, monthly payment costs, and cash needed to close (including the down payment).</p><h2>Common types of closing costs explained</h2><p>There are separate closing costs for buyers and sellers. Your location, state law, lender requirements, and the terms of the agreement will determine which ones you’re responsible for.</p><p>“Typically, the closing costs are paid by those who create the cost, known as 'each to pay their own,'” DeHart says. “However, as with all parts of the transaction, who is responsible for paying what is negotiable and decided within the offer/counteroffer process.”</p><p>With that in mind, these are the main types of closing costs and who typically pays them:</p><ul><li><strong>Appraisal fee: </strong>A home appraisal determines the property’s value compared to similar properties in the area. The buyer typically pays this at closing.</li><li><strong>Application fee: </strong>Some mortgage lenders charge an application fee when you apply for a loan. This may be included with the total closing costs and is typically paid by the buyer.</li><li><strong>Attorney fees: </strong>Certain states require a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/real-estate-lawyer\">real estate lawyer</a> to be present at closing. The buyer usually pays attorney fees.</li><li><strong>Credit report fee: </strong>Lenders typically pull your credit report to determine whether to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval-documents\">approve your loan</a>, its terms, amount, and interest rate. Buyers can expect to pay about $30 per credit report.</li><li><strong>Discount points: </strong>Mortgage discount points can let you buy down your interest rate by paying extra at closing. Discount points are optional, and usually paid by the buyer.</li><li><strong>Origination fees: </strong>Home loans come with an origination fee, which is the cost of processing and underwriting the loan. This is a closing cost for buyers.</li><li><strong>Prepaid interest or </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-escrow\"><strong>escrow fees</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The buyer typically needs to pay certain costs in advance, including homeowners insurance or mortgage insurance premiums, property taxes, and homeowners association (HOA) fees. The buyer may also need to prepay any interest that incurs between closing date and the first loan payment.</li><li><strong>Property survey fee: </strong>Depending on where the property is located, the buyer may need to get a survey of the property before finalizing the transaction.</li><li><strong>Recording fee: </strong>This may be required to update any changes to ownership of the property. It’s included in the buyer’s closing disclosure.</li><li><strong>Taxes: </strong>The buyer may need to pay government or transfer taxes to finalize the home purchase process.</li><li><strong>Title insurance policy fee:&nbsp;</strong> Lenders often require homebuyers to have title insurance. Title insurance protects you as the buyer against potential claims against the property prior to purchase.</li><li><strong>Title search fee: </strong>A title search can tell you who legally owned the property before you and whether there are any current claims or liens against it.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, closing costs primarily fall on the buyer, though the seller may pay some costs as well.</p><p>“Closing costs usually affect the buyer more because they're the ones paying most of the fees. However, sellers could feel the impact, too — especially if they agree to pay some of the costs as part of the deal,” says Michael Branson, CEO of All Reverse Mortgage, Inc.</p><p>According to Branson, it depends on whether it’s a buyer’s or seller’s market.</p><p>“In competitive markets, sellers might offer to pay a portion to attract buyers, but in a seller’s market, buyers usually shoulder most of the cost,” he says. “So it could all really come down to the specific deal and market conditions.”</p><h2>How are closing costs calculated?</h2><p>As you go about the homebuying process, it’s important to understand how closing costs are calculated. Some closing costs (such as the credit report fee) will be a set amount regardless of your loan or property size. Other costs (such as taxes, escrow fees, or discount points) will depend on your property and loan. You can typically estimate closing costs to be about 2% to 5% of the home’s sale price.</p><p>“The final number can still go higher or lower, based on several things like the home location, loan type, lender's policies, possible negotiations, and more,” Branson says.</p><p>When you apply for a loan, you should receive a loan estimate detailing the possible closing costs. You can use this as a baseline to determine how much your total upfront costs are going to be.</p><p>Before formally agreeing to a loan, compare the loan estimate with the closing disclosure. The closing disclosure will provide more accurate details of the loan, including the total amount needed for closing.</p><h2>Tips for reducing closing costs</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-launches-inquiry-into-junk-fees-in-mortgage-closing-costs/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a>, closing costs rose by 36% from 2021 to 2023. While some closing costs are unavoidable, here are some ways to lower your total upfront expenses:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lower-priced services: </strong>Compare different service providers, like the title insurance and home inspection companies, to find the best price. According to Branson, you could save a few hundred dollars this way.</li><li><strong>Negotiate for lower fees: </strong>Lender fees can add up, so see if you can negotiate some of these down.</li><li><strong>Use lender credits: </strong>Lender credits can lower closing costs in exchange for a higher interest rate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider a no-closing-cost loan: </strong>Certain lenders offer loans without upfront closing costs that let you fold costs into the overall loan amount. While this reduces your cash at closing, you’ll have a higher loan amount overall.</li><li><strong>Look into assistance programs: </strong>Some borrowers, especially <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/first-time-home-buyer-programs\">first-time homebuyers</a> or low- to moderate-income households, qualify for down payment and closing cost assistance programs. This can reduce the upfront costs and make it easier to afford a home. Depending on the program, you may need to repay any assistance received.</li></ul><p>“Another thing you can do is to ask the seller to cover part of the closing costs,” Branson says. “This is what we call a seller concession — and while it usually depends on the market and how motivated the seller is to close the deal, doing this can greatly reduce your upfront expenses.”</p><h2>Closing costs: What buyers and sellers need to know</h2><p>Closing costs are the fees involved in finalizing a real estate transaction. They include appraisal fees, title search fees, government taxes, and loan servicing fees. They’re usually paid by the buyer, but the seller may contribute as well.</p><p>The closing cost amount depends on factors like location and property value. Typically, they’re 2% to 5% of the home purchase price. For a $400,000 home, expect to pay anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000 in closing costs.</p><p>When getting a mortgage, be sure to review the loan estimate alongside the closing disclosure for any major discrepancies. Before closing, you may be able to reduce closing costs by negotiating with your lender, shopping around for cheaper service providers, or choosing a no-closing-cost loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:283798":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"283798","content":"<p>Over 2 million students pursuing a graduate degree completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in the 2023-24 application cycle, according to Federal Student Aid data.

Promotional periods typically last 12 to 18 months.</p><p>When the promotional period ends, your remaining balance is subject to the card's regular APR. In other words, if you can pay off the entire balance before the rate adjusts, you can enjoy an interest-free loan. However, if you’re transferring a balance, most cards have a transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred — a cost to think about if you're using a 0% APR card to consolidate debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan Kuderna, certified financial planner and founder of Kuderna Financial Team, warns that while 0% APR credit cards can be enticing, it's important to use them with care and have a “firm exit plan to pay the balance in full” before the promotional period ends. “0% promos and other teaser rates sound great, but lenders are able to offer them because they know enough borrowers will carry their debt past the promo period and begin paying high interest thereafter.”</p><p>Credit card issuers typically require a hard credit check before approving you for a card.

This is due to the hard credit check typically required during the application process.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improves your credit mix:</strong> A personal loan is an installment loan; a credit card is a revolving credit line. Adding either one to your credit report can improve your credit mix (and, therefore, your score) if you don't already have that type of account.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Adds a new credit account:</strong> Opening a new line of credit — installment or revolving — lowers the average age of your credit accounts. Length of credit history makes up 15% of your total credit score. (A longer credit history is better.)</li><li><strong>Can reduce credit utilization:</strong> Credit utilization is unique to revolving credit lines. It measures the amount of credit you use relative to how much you have available. By increasing your available credit, you reduce your credit utilization, which can improve your score. Keeping your credit utilization below 30% of your total credit limit is generally the goal.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>On-time payments:</strong> On-time payments influence 35% of your credit score, making it the most impactful factor. This is why it can be wise to choose a longer-term personal loan with a higher APR (relative to a 0% APR credit card) if you can get lower payments.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:280122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"280122","content":"<h2>Examples of when either option is a better choice</h2><p>Different forms of credit exist for various borrowing needs. For some, a flexible credit card with a 0% APR promotional period might work better than a more rigid personal loan, or vice versa. Here are a few scenarios when one option could outweigh the other.</p><h3>Scenarios when personal loans make more sense</h3><ul><li><strong>You need a fixed monthly payment:</strong> With a fixed rate, your loan payment won't change throughout its term, unlike a credit card with a promotional rate. “I don’t recommend pursuing the card route if it requires juggling balances or if you lack a stable income,” says Epps. “Predictable and straightforward beats clever and risky every time.”</li><li><strong>You need more time:</strong> You'll also get more time to pay a personal loan, in most cases, which is helpful for borrowers who aren't 100% confident they can pay off their card balance — or avoid adding new charges to it — before its promotional period ends.</li><li><strong>You need cash:</strong> Personal loans are also a better fit for some expenses that you typically can't pay with a credit card, like private contractors or some utility bills.</li><li><strong>You need more money:</strong> An installment loan can generally help you access higher borrowing limits than a credit card.</li><li><strong>You’re consolidating credit card debt:</strong> A distinct advantage of personal loans is that they don’t impact your credit utilization. So if you use one to pay off credit card debt, you can swiftly decrease your credit utilization (as long as you keep the cards open) and thereby improve your credit score.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Scenarios when 0% APR credit cards make more sense</h3><ul><li><strong>You can pay off the balance within the promotional period:</strong> This is key to getting the most benefit out of a 0% APR credit card.</li><li><strong>You can benefit from rewards and perks:</strong> A credit card could make more sense if you’re eligible for a sign-on bonus — like if you spend a certain amount within three months — and can comfortably pay off the balance before the rate adjusts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You’ll pay off new purchases monthly:</strong> If you can pay off your balance monthly, a credit card can be a great tool for temporary interest-free financing.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You need to transfer a small balance:</strong> Say you have $1,000 left to pay on a credit card with a 30% APR. Your payment would be around $100 per month to pay it off in 1 year, and you'd pay $170 in interest. If you move the balance to a 0% APR credit card with a 12-month promotional period and a 5% balance transfer fee, your new balance becomes $1,050. Your payment on the new card would be less than $88 per month with only the $50 transfer fee.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:280126":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"280126","content":"<h2>Alternative funding options to consider</h2><p>Personal loans and 0% APR credit cards may not be the best fit for some borrowers. As you explore options, consider these funding alternatives:</p><ul><li><strong>Payday alternative loan:</strong> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loan</a> (PAL) is a small-dollar personal loan from a federal credit union. You can borrow between $200 and $1,000 with a repayment term of 1 to 6 months, or up to $2,000 for 1 to 12 months, depending on the type of PAL.</li><li><strong>Savings-secured loan:</strong> You can use a savings account to secure a loan for low-cost borrowing. Savings-secured loans are relatively easy to qualify for compared to an unsecured loan. The amount you borrow stays in your savings account, but as frozen collateral. As you make payments on the loan, that amount of money becomes available to you again.</li><li><strong>401(k) loan:</strong> Some 401(k) plans allow loans against your policy. Like a savings-secured loan, a 401(k) loan is typically straightforward to qualify for since you borrow against your own funds. But be aware of its potential impact on your long-term goals, such as reduced growth on your retirement savings and potential tax penalties if you leave your job before repaying the loan and can’t pay it back.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Home equity-based financing:</strong> A home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) can offer competitive interest rates as you borrow against your home’s equity. But you could lose your home if you default. “Be cautious with any loan that puts your assets, especially your home or retirement, at risk,” warns Xavier Epps, finance expert and owner of FinanceGuyX, LLC. “Just because you can borrow doesn’t mean you should.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Salary advance:</strong> Your employer might be willing to give you an advance on your salary to fund an emergency expense, often for little to no interest or fees. The amount you borrow will usually get deducted from your next paycheck, so make sure you have a plan in place for your smaller payday.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/family-loans\"><strong>Friends and family loan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Your close friends or family might be willing to help if you have an emergency expense to cover.

Paying an extra $100 per month could get you out of debt three years ahead of schedule.</p><p>“When students graduate and begin earning, building the right financial habits is key,” says Safdari.</p><p>“I advise students not to rush into buying a new car or upgrading their lifestyle immediately. Instead, focus on making double or triple the minimum monthly payments,” he adds.</p><p>If you can't afford regular monthly payments, you could make one-off payments if you get a cash windfall, such as a tax refund or bonus at work. You might also round your usual payments up to the nearest dollar or multiple of 10, as any little bit helps.</p><p>Another option is switching to a biweekly payment schedule instead of a monthly one. By paying every two weeks, you'll make an extra full payment each year without much extra budgeting on your part.</p><h2>Use the debt avalanche or snowball method</h2><p>If you're juggling multiple student loans, it's tough to know which loan to prioritize. Two student loan payoff strategies that can help are the debt avalanche and the debt snowball.</p><ul><li><strong>Debt avalanche: </strong>With this method, you target your loan with the highest interest rate first. You make the minimum payments on all your loans, while focusing on putting more money toward your highest-interest loan until it's paid off. You then move on to the loan with the next-highest interest rate and repeat the process until all your loans are paid off.</li><li><strong>Debt snowball: </strong>With this strategy, you pay off your loan with the lowest balance first. You prioritize this loan before moving on to the next-smallest, and so on.</li></ul><p>The debt avalanche is the best method if you want to save the most on interest with accelerated loan repayment. However, the debt snowball can be valuable too, as you might feel a boost in your motivation after paying off your smallest loan in full. There's no wrong answer here — simply choose the method that helps you stay on track toward your debt payoff goals.</p><h2>How to decide if 10 years is the right timeline for student loan repayment</h2><p>Paying off student loans in 10 years could be the right timeline if you can afford the monthly payments. Ask yourself the following questions to determine whether a 10-year repayment plan is right for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Is your income stable enough for larger payments? </strong>A 10-year repayment plan will require higher monthly payments than a plan with a longer term. Consider whether your income is sufficient and steady enough to afford these higher payments.</li><li><strong>Do you have emergency savings or retirement goals?</strong> Don't wait until you've paid off your student loan debt to build an emergency fund or set money aside for retirement. Avoid funneling all your extra money into student loans if it would come at the cost of your financial security.</li><li><strong>Would a longer term with lower monthly payments help cash flow?</strong> Lower monthly payments would free up more room in your budget for daily expenses or savings goals. If your cash flow is tight, you may benefit from a repayment term that spans more than 10 years. Keep in mind that a longer term will give you lower monthly payments but increase your long-term interest costs.</li></ul><p>Although you may want to become debt-free as fast as possible, you don't want to do so at the expense of your other financial goals. Try to strike a balance between paying off your student loans, building an emergency fund, saving for retirement, and preserving enough cash flow for day-to-day expenses. That way, you can make steady progress on your student loans without sacrificing your financial security.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:278378":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"278378","content":"<p>With Credible personal loans, you get access to a free online marketplace and dozens of lenders providing same- and next-day loans for debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses, and more.

You can receive between $100 and $4,000 annually, depending on other aid you've received, your school's funding, and when you apply.</li><li><strong>Federal work-study program: </strong>The federal work-study program allows you to work part-time on or off campus. The job is usually relevant to your course of study or civic engagement. You'll be allowed a certain number of hours of work and must be paid at least the minimum wage. Money earned can go toward your college expenses.</li><li><strong>State and institutional need-based aid: </strong>Many states and schools offer their own need-based grants and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a>.

If the underwriter doesn’t have all of the information they need, this can slow down the time it takes for them to do their job.</li><li><strong>Unusual finances: </strong>Another factor that can slow things down is if you have a unique financial situation.

With that, you might face a heavier tax burden in the year you receive student loan forgiveness through the PAYE Plan.</p><p>The payments you make under the PAYE Plan can also count toward programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">PSLF</a>) if you decide to pursue that instead.</p><h2>PAYE vs. other income-driven repayment plans</h2><p>“Federal student loans offer a multitude of repayment plans,” says Jack Wang, a wealth adviser specializing in college financial aid at Innovative Advisory Group.</p><p>These choices can present a sticky situation for borrowers trying to find the best option for their situation.</p><p>Wang continues, “This doesn't happen anywhere else and we, as consumers, just aren't used to being able to change how much we have to pay without having to refinance a loan. For example, we can't just arbitrarily change our mortgage payment and expect the bank to accept that.”</p><p>But in the realm of student loans, PAYE and other income-driven repayment plans make it possible for eligible borrowers to change their plan and opt for a different monthly payment.</p><p>Here's a look at how PAYE compares to the other IDR options.</p><h3>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan</a> is available to borrowers with Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, grad PLUS loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans (as long as they didn't repay parent PLUS loans). Like the PAYE Plan, IBR has a cap so that your monthly payment will never be higher than what you'd pay on the Standard Repayment Plan.</p><p>Depending on when you borrowed, your monthly payment may equal 10% or 15% of your discretionary income, and your repayment term will either be 20 or 25 years.</p><h3>Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">SAVE Plan</a>, which replaced the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan, offers the most generous repayment structure. The plan excludes 225% of the poverty line for your situation from your AGI. Your monthly payment will be 5% of your discretionary income if you have only undergraduate loans, and a weighted average between 5% and 10% if you have a mixture of undergraduate and graduate loans. However, unlike PAYE, your payments under SAVE aren't capped.</p><p>Your repayment term for SAVE could be as few as 10 years if you originally took out $12,000 or less in student loans. Every $1,000 above that adds another year to your repayment term.</p><p>Practically since its inception, the SAVE Plan has faced significant legal challenges. As of February 2025, the SAVE Plan is on pause — borrowers enrolled in the plan are in a general forbearance and don't owe any payments at the moment.</p><p>For many, the more generous terms of the SAVE Plan might make sense. But it's not the best fit for everyone.</p><p>“If you're approaching 120 payments for PSLF, you might consider changing to an 'active' repayment plan like PAYE or IBR,” says Robert Farrington, founder of The College Investor.</p><p>“I recommend this for borrowers with less than 10 payments left until forgiveness, so they can simply get it done this year,” Farrington adds.</p><h3>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-contingent-repayment\">ICR Plan</a> is the only income-driven repayment plan that allows parent PLUS loan borrowers to qualify (by consolidating with a Direct Consolidation Loan). Under the this plan, your payment is the lesser of 20% of your discretionary income or what you'd pay on a fixed repayment plan over the course of 12 years, adjusted according to your income. Your repayment term is 25 years. Unlike PAYE, there's no payment cap under ICR.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:13110":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"13110","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"compare-rates"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:276022":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"276022","content":"<h2>How to apply for the PAYE repayment plan</h2><p>If you want to sign up for the PAYE Plan, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Log in to StudentAid.gov: </strong>You'll need your Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID and password.</li><li><strong>Submit an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan Request:</strong> Start the process by completing an application for the PAYE Plan.</li><li><strong>Verify your income: </strong>You'll need to add your financial information and may need documents such as tax returns or pay stubs.</li></ul><p>According to StudentAid.gov, it takes most people just 10 minutes to complete the application.

When shopping around for a loan, compare the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> Think of a loan's interest rate as the cost of borrowing (excluding fees). The higher the interest rate, the more expensive the loan. Focus your search on lenders that offer lower interest rates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Fees increase the cost of borrowing. Common fees for personal loans include origination fees and late fees, though not all lenders charge them. Note that lenders in Georgia may be prohibited from charging origination fees.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> If you need funds in a hurry, choose a lender that funds loans quickly. For example, Avant and LightStream may be able to fund your loan as soon as the same or the next business day you apply.</li><li><strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong> Check your credit score and lenders' eligibility <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">requirements</a> to get an idea of which loans you might qualify for. Some lenders require excellent or good credit, while others offer loans to people with fair credit or bad credit. A few lenders, like Upstart, offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-credit-history-loans\">loans for people with no credit history</a>.</li><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Depending on how much you need to borrow, some lenders may not be suitable. Many lenders cap loans around $50,000, but some, including SoFi, loan up to $100,000 or more.</li><li><strong>Lender reputation:</strong> Jason Anderson, certified financial planner and director of the Personal Finance Program at the University of Kansas School of Business, says that beyond rates, fees, and other hard facts about lenders, don't overlook the reputation and stability of different lenders. \"This is becoming increasingly important as fintech-bank partnerships become increasingly common in the online marketplace,\" says Anderson.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:245470":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"245470","content":"<ul><li><strong>Ability to add a cosigner:</strong> If your financial situation makes it difficult to qualify for an affordable interest rate (or if you're struggling to qualify at all), you may want to use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">cosigner or co-applicant</a>. This can increase your chances of approval and help you qualify for a better rate, but not all lenders allow it. Also, the lender may hold the cosigner or co-applicant responsible if you default on the loan.</li><li><strong>Customer satisfaction:</strong> Consult previous customers' experiences to verify a lender's reputation. Check out sites like the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> or <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> to find ratings and reviews.</li></ul><h2>What are personal loans and how do they work?</h2><h3>What they are</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> is a type of installment loan you can use to pay for a variety of expenses, including emergencies, vacations, weddings, debt consolidation, and more.</p><p>Personal loans can be either <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\">secured or unsecured</a>. Secured loans require collateral, while unsecured personal loans don't. Unsecured loans may have higher interest rates or stricter eligibility requirements.</p><h3>Where to find them and how to qualify</h3><p>You can get a personal loan at many banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions, but you have to meet the lender's eligibility requirements to qualify. This typically involves meeting specific credit, income, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) benchmarks.</p><h3>Funding and repayment</h3><p>If you're approved for a loan, the lender funds it in a lump sum. After receiving the funds, you'll repay the loan balance, plus interest, over the course of your loan's term - often two to seven years. The size of your monthly payment depends on your loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term. Most personal loans have a fixed interest rate, meaning your payment won't change month to month.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>Additionally, personal loans may come with fees, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a>, application fees, or late payment fees, which can add to the cost of borrowing.</p><h2>Pros and cons of personal loans</h2><p>Personal loans have both advantages and disadvantages to consider.

Plus, you receive your entire loan amount upfront, allowing you to spend the funds as needed.</li><li><strong>Potentially lower interest rates:</strong> Generally, personal loans offer lower interest rates compared to credit cards. However, the lowest rates are reserved for those with excellent credit, and personal loan rates vary based on borrower profile and loan term.</li><li><strong>No collateral for unsecured loans:</strong> If you take out an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\">unsecured loan</a>, you don't need to worry about putting up collateral.

While they may not charge interest, they might charge other fees or solicit tips. The Center for Responsible Lending found that <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/not-free-large-hidden-costs-small-dollar-loans-made-through-cash-advance-apps\">cash advance app APRs</a> average in the triple-digits, rivaling payday loan APRs.</li><li><strong>Home equity loan:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> lets you take out a loan against your home equity, securing your loan with your house.

Making the right decision can save you money, time, and headaches. When shopping for loans, compare the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Annual percentage rate:</strong> Though bad-credit borrowers tend to face higher interest rates, rates can vary by lender. For instance, payday alternative loans (PALs) from federal credit unions currently cap interest rates at 28% and many online lenders cap rates at 36%. <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/red-alert-rates-annual-percentage-rates-400-single-payment-payday-loans-united\">Payday loan rates in California</a>, however, can be over 400% APR.</li><li><strong>Total loan cost:</strong> While the loan's APR expresses the cost to borrow on an annual basis, it doesn't necessarily represent the total cost of the loan. You need to consider the repayment term for that. Use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to compare total loan costs, such as a 3-year loan to a 5-year loan, based on its APR. Longer-term loans, even if they have a lower monthly payment, may have higher overall costs. “Borrowers often overlook the total cost of the loan, including interest rates, fees, and repayment terms,” says Shirley Mueller, senior vice president of Mortgage Lending at CrossCountry Mortgage. “It's important to understand the long-term financial impact.”</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> Some lenders, especially online lenders, can fund a loan within one day of approval. Others may take several days or more. Consider how quickly you need the loan and check <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">lenders' funding times</a> when shopping around. Be careful to avoid predatory loans (like <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a> and some cash advance apps) that can deliver money instantly, but charge very high fees to do so.</li><li><strong>Ability to add a cosigner or a co-borrower:</strong> If you have bad credit, adding a <a href=\"/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">cosigner or a co-borrower</a> to your application can be a big advantage. Either can help you qualify for a lower interest rate and/or a larger loan if you have good credit. Only a few lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">loans with cosigners</a>. More lenders allow co-borrowers. The difference is that a cosigner merely guarantees the loan, while a co-borrower has equal access to the loan funds. The loan is added to your cosigner's or co-borrower's credit report, and can hurt or help their credit as it can yours.</li><li><strong>Customer satisfaction:</strong> Regardless of your credit score, you deserve a good customer experience. Get a sense of a lender's reputation through customer reviews and ratings on the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> websites. Mueller suggests consulting the <a href=\"https://dfpi.ca.gov/\">California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation</a>, which allows you to verify California providers and look up legal action taken against them.</li></ul><h2>What are bad credit loans and how do they work?</h2><p>A bad credit loan is a loan you can qualify for even with a poor credit score.

While many lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">loan amounts</a> starting at $1,000 or higher, you might be able to find a few lenders that will lend you $500. For example:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/navy-federal-personal-loans-review\"><strong>Navy Federal Credit Union</strong></a> offers personal loans as low as $250 and up to $50,000, with <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APRs</a> (annual percentages rates) from 8.74% to 18.00%, depending on your credit and the length of the loan term. Available terms last up to 60 months. However, you have to be a member of the credit union to qualify.</li><li><strong>OppLoans </strong>offers $500 to $5,000 loans, but APRs range up to 195%. These APRs are high relative to other personal loans, but they're much lower than payday loan APRs, which can reach 400% or more. OppLoans reports payments to the credit bureaus and offers terms up to 18 months. Consider this option only if you can't qualify for a traditional personal loans.</li></ul><p>Note that a personal loan’s APR represents the annualized cost of borrowing — the interest rate plus any upfront lender fees, such as origination fees.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267842":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267842","content":"<p>Compared to most other small loan options, personal loans have longer repayment periods, smaller monthly payments, and lower APRs.

Upon approval, the cash is sent to your bank account, typically within three business days for free. If you need money the same day, most apps charge an express transfer fee or expedited funds fee — this is where cash apps can get expensive.</p><p>For example, Dave charges a minimum per advance fee of $5 plus 1.5% of the transferred amount to send cash to an external debit card within an hour. So, it would cost $12.50 to transfer $500 to your debit card, which equates to an APR of 65% if repaid in two weeks. If you add a $5 tip, the APR increases to 91%.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267850":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267850","content":"<p>While cash advance apps can be quick and convenient, potential drawbacks include:</p><ul><li><strong>Costs that add up:</strong> Membership fees, tips, express fees, and other charges can add to the cost of a cash advance, even with no interest charges. The <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/nodes/files/research-publication/crl-not-free-hidden-costs-apr2024.pdf\">Center for Responsible Lending</a> found that the average cost of a cash advance paid in seven to 14 days was the equivalent of paying 367% APR, rivaling that of some payday loans.</li><li><strong>Low loan amounts:</strong> The majority of advances from cash advance apps are in the $100-$200 range, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. Dave notes on its website that the average ExtraCash advance is $170.</li><li><strong>Multiple advances:</strong> Because the advances are typically small amounts, users may find themselves taking out multiple advances — and paying the resulting fees for each one.</li></ul><p>In short, it's a good idea to avoid cash advance apps — or to at least avoid paying tips and fees for same-day funds.</p><h3>3.<strong> </strong>Cash advance with a credit card</h3><p>Most credit cards allow you to withdraw up to a certain percentage of your credit line in cash through an ATM or bank. The upfront fees are commonly around 3% to 5% of the advance amount. So, a $500 cash advance could cost you $15 to $25 plus interest.</p><p>Importantly, cash advances often have APRs of 30% (or more) that apply immediately and until you pay the amount off in full. For example, if your APR is 30% and your advance is $500 plus a $25 fee, the advance would cost about $13 in interest per billing cycle.</p><p>Credit card cash advances can be convenient if you already have a credit card, but the combination of the fee and interest charges could make them relatively expensive.</p><p><strong>Compare:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">Payday Loan vs. Cash Advance</a></p><h3>4. Payday alternative loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loans (PALs)</a> are small, affordable loans offered by certain federal credit unions. They were designed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to create an affordable alternative to payday loans.&nbsp;</p><p>The issuing credit union can only charge fees to cover the actual costs of processing the loan applications (and only up to $20). APRs are capped at 28%. Two types of PALs are available:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267854":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267854","content":"<p>Check the <a href=\"https://mapping.ncua.gov/ResearchCreditUnion\">NCUA website</a> to look for credit unions in your area. Note that membership eligibility requirements vary, although many credit unions are relatively easy to join.&nbsp;</p><h3>5. BNPL apps</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)</a> apps provide short-term (and sometimes longer-term), interest-free financing for online and in-store purchases. BNPL apps are a type of installment loan and funding is instant once you're approved. Unlike the previous loan types, you don't receive the cash directly.</p><p>When you make a purchase with a BNPL app, you may or may not need to make a down payment. Several apps allow you to choose a payment plan. “Pay in 4” plans are common, splitting your payment into four equal installments. But you may also be able to spread your payments over several months or years.</p><p>Most BNPL apps don't require a hard credit pull for short-term funding, but may for longer-term options. Some BNPL companies like Affirm report payments to credit bureaus, which can help build your credit score.&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Small bank loans</h3><p>Some banks, such as Bank of America and U.S. Bank, offer small loans. But you generally need to have an account in order to qualify. &nbsp;For example, Bank of America offers a balance assist program of $500, which is repaid over three months for a $5 flat fee. Check with your bank or credit union to see if similar low-cost loan options are available.</p><h3>7. Payday loans (not recommended)</h3><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> refers to a small, short-term loan that you repay from your next paycheck — often within two to four weeks. They generally don't require a credit check, but they typically have very high costs. Fees can equate to 400% APR or higher, depending on your state. Many states regulate their maximum loan amounts, terms, and finance charges. A handful of states have even banned them.</p><p>If you're considering a payday loan, use a payday loan calculator to see what the APR is. Then, compare that to other options like a cash advance app (ideally, without a fast-funding fee or tips) and a credit card cash advance (if available). If you're eligible for membership with a credit union offering PALs, go that route instead.</p><h2>How to qualify for a small personal loan</h2><p>Common eligibility criteria for obtaining a $500 personal loan include:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> You may need to meet <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirements</a>. Applicants with FICO scores below 580 (the poor credit range) may have trouble qualifying, although some lenders cater to borrowers with bad credit. If you don’t know your credit score, check it for free with Credible’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">credit-monitoring tool</a>.</li><li><strong>Credit report:</strong> Lenders often check your credit report to review your payment history, outstanding debts, and other records. Derogatory marks or high credit utilization rates can result in denials. Get a free copy of your credit report at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> and check it for incorrect or outdated information.</li><li><strong>Income:</strong> Lenders may check your income amounts, sources, and payment frequency.</li><li><strong>Employment status:</strong> Many lenders require you to be actively employed and will ask about your employment history.</li><li><strong>Valid government ID:</strong> You typically need a valid identification document from the U.S. government.</li><li><strong>Active bank account:</strong> You might need to have an open and active bank account where the funds can be deposited. Some lenders give you the option of paying the money from a debt consolidation loan directly to your creditors.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>How quickly can I get a $500 loan?</h2><p>Here are the funding times you can expect from various providers:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal loan lenders:</strong> Some <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan lenders</a> can make approval decisions within minutes and deposit the funds as soon as the next business day or, depending on the lender, the same business day. Others can take up to a week.</li><li><strong>Payday loan lenders:</strong> Online loans are typically funded the next business day, while in-store loans are funded the same day.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Standard bank transfers can take up to 3 business days or longer, depending on the app, while express transfers can be completed in seconds or minutes.</li><li><strong>Credit card providers:</strong> Once approved, it can take 5 to 7 business days to receive a credit card in the mail.

Common fees include application fees, <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">loan origination fees</a>, late payment fees, and more.</li><li><strong>Loan term:</strong> The term determines <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">how long you have to repay the loan</a>. It affects the amount of interest you have to pay and the loan's APR. Short-term loans that charge fees tend to have high APRs. For loans that charge interest: The longer your repayment period, the more interest you generally pay.</li></ul><p>For example, let's say you take out a $500 loan with a 25% APR and a 10-month term. Your monthly payment would be $55.91. By the time you pay off the loan, you'll have repaid the $500 plus about $59 in interest.</p><p>On the other hand, if you were to borrow $500 via a payday loan, you could be charged $75 ($15 per $100 borrowed). The $575 would then be due within two to four weeks. A two-week loan would have an APR of 391%. If you can't repay the full amount on time, payday loan lenders often charge additional fees to extend your payment terms.</p><p>The personal loan is cheaper than the payday loan and allows for more affordable payments over a longer repayment term.</p><h2>What to consider before taking out a $500 loan</h2><p>Making a decision too quickly is a common mistake for a lot of borrowers, according to Tyler West, MPA, AFC, and Financial Guide at Your Money Line.</p><p>“Borrowers may feel that they have to find a solution quickly,” says West, which can lead to overlooking major consequences. “When you are considering borrowing, it is important to force yourself to slow down and review all the information involved in the decision-making process.”</p><p>The following considerations can help you make an informed decision about taking out a loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Determine how soon you need the money:</strong> If you need the money as soon as possible, a cash advance or BNPL loan may be your best option. If you can wait several days, a personal loan or PAL is likely a better solution. However, if you don't need the money in the near future, try saving up for the expense rather than borrowing.</li><li><strong>Compare costs of different loans:</strong> Interest rates, fees, and repayment terms vary between lenders and loan types. Use an APR calculator to compare your options to make sure you don't spend more on a loan than you need to.</li><li><strong>Consult your budget:</strong> Before taking out a loan, take a close look at your budget. Make sure you can afford the monthly installments so you don't fall behind on repayment — otherwise, you risk damaging your credit and potentially facing calls for collection.</li><li><strong>Get clear about your intentions:</strong> Know why you need to borrow money, what you'll spend it on, and how much you need. Consider whether the expense is really worth taking on debt. Be honest with yourself and borrow only what you need.</li><li><strong>Weigh all your options: </strong>A $500 loan may not be the smartest way to get money. Consider alternative options like payment plans, charitable grants, government assistance, or borrowing from friends or family.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267858":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267858","content":"<h2>Interest rates and loan amounts by credit score</h2><p>Borrowers with high credit scores are the most likely to qualify for the lowest interest rates and highest loan amounts.

Some credit unions offer more membership pathways than others, but others may require you to live in a certain area, work for a specific employer, or be part of an affiliated group.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/navy-federal-personal-loans-review\">Navy Federal Credit Union</a> offers personal loans of up to $150,000 for home improvement, but you must apply with a co-applicant. Alliant Credit Union offers personal loans of up to $100,000.</p><h2>How to compare $95K personal loans</h2><p>Borrowing $95,000 is a decision with several considerations. Loans can have widely different interest rates, fees, and monthly payments. Here's how to compare your options from different lenders.</p><h3>1. Interest rates</h3><p>A personal loan's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, or APR, accounts for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees. APR provides the most comprehensive way to measure the cost of borrowing money on an annualized basis.</p><p>Lenders typically charge between 6.49% and 35.99% APR for personal loans. However, your rate depends on several factors, like your credit score and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a>.</p><p>For example, Wells Fargo estimates that borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher (very good credit, according to the FICO score range) may be eligible for an APR of 11.50% to 16.00% on a seven-year, $95,000 loan. Meanwhile, borrowers with credit scores in the 700 to 759 (good credit, according to FICO) may qualify for APRs of 17.25% to 19.00% on the same loan.</p><h3>2. Fees</h3><p>Not all lenders charge fees to borrow $95,000. For lenders that do, these fees can increase your total repayment costs.</p><p>Late fees are among the most common, but they only occur if you're late making a payment. Lenders usually give a grace period for missed payments before assessing a late fee, which is typically a flat fee or a percentage of your missed payment amount.</p><p>Your lender may also impose an upfront fee, also called an origination fee, to offset their administrative fees or reduce their risk. Origination fees typically range from less than 1% to as much as 15% of the loan amount, and lenders generally deduct the fee from your loan upfront. So, if you borrow $95,000 with a 2% origination fee, you would receive $93,100.</p><p>Less common for personal loans is a prepayment penalty, which is a lender's charge for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">paying off your loan early</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265850":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265850","content":"<h3>3. Repayment terms</h3><p>Your repayment term is the length of time you have to pay off your loan. Lenders typically offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">two- to seven-year terms</a>, although BHG Financial offers repayment terms of three to 10 years. You can sometimes get longer repayment terms for specific loan purposes, like home repairs. For example, LightStream allows up to 20 years to pay off home improvement loans.</p><p>A longer loan term can lower your monthly payment by spreading the amount you owe over more months. But a longer repayment term typically means higher interest costs over the life of the loan, so you'll need to weigh whether lower monthly payments or paying less interest overall best fits your financial goals.</p><h3>4. Monthly payment</h3><p>You'll pay a $95,000 personal loan in equal installments each month that include your principal and interest. Your monthly payment should fit comfortably into your monthly budget, but keep in mind that a loan for $95,000 could cost around $2,000 per month or more, unless you get an extended repayment term or a very low interest rate.</p><p>When comparing loan quotes, look at how different repayment terms and APRs affect your monthly payment. Many online lenders offer calculators for loan estimates or let you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a loan</a> to see what you may qualify for and get an idea of your potential monthly payment.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265854":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265854","content":"<h3>5. Total repayment costs</h3><p>One way to gauge whether a $95,000 personal loan fits into your financial picture is to consider your total repayment costs, including the total interest charged and fees. For example, if you borrow $95,000 with a 23% APR for seven years, you'll end up paying about $96,000 in interest alone, more than the amount you borrowed. Use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to break down these costs ahead of time.</p><h2>What is the cost to repay a $95,000 loan?</h2><p>A $95,000 personal loan repaid over at least five years would likely have a monthly payment of $2,000 or more, which equates to over $40,000 in total interest paid over the loan term. Here's a look at how much a five-year and seven-year $95,000 loan could cost you.</p><h3>Five-year repayment</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265858":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265858","content":"<h3>Seven-year repayment</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265862":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265862","content":"<h2>How to get a $95K personal loan</h2><h3>Review your credit profile</h3><p>Check your credit score with Credible's free <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">credit-monitoring tool</a> and order a free copy of your credit report from <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.

These estimates can help you strike a balance between a monthly payment you can comfortably afford and how much interest you want to pay over the life of the loan.</p><h3>Apply</h3><p>Choose the lender offering the rate, terms, and services you prefer. Submit an official application and include all documents requested by the lender, such as income verification.</p><h3>Review and sign the loan agreement</h3><p>Once approved, you'll need to review the loan agreement from your lender. It details all the fine print about your loan, including your interest rate, monthly payment, fees, and prohibited loan uses. If you agree to all terms, sign the document and send it back to your lender.</p><h3>Get funded</h3><p>Lenders usually fund loans within a few business days of signing the agreement, but check with your lender about its funding times. Your lender will also let you know when your first payment is due.</p><h2>Alternatives to a $95,000 loan</h2><p>Home equity and secured funding options may offer lower interest rates than a personal loan, but still give you access to $95,000.</p><h3>Use your home equity</h3><p>Home equity is the amount of your home and property you own outright. For example, if your home is worth $400,000 and you owe $150,000 on your mortgage, you have $250,000 in home equity. Some banks and credit unions offer home equity borrowing options to tap into this equity. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Home equity loan:</strong> A home equity loan is a lump sum payment with a fixed interest rate and repayment term, similar to a personal loan. It's a good option if you know exactly how much you need to borrow.</li><li><strong>Home equity line of credit (HELOC):</strong> You'll get flexible access to funds as needed with a HELOC, up to a set credit limit. Unlike a personal loan, a HELOC usually has a variable interest rate, and you only pay interest on what you borrow. So, if you're not sure you need as much as $95,000, you could save some money with a HELOC.</li><li><strong>Cash-out refinance:</strong> A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a larger one, allowing you to borrow the extra money to use for virtually any purpose. You may also get a better interest rate than your current mortgage by refinancing.</li></ul><p>While beneficial in some cases, home equity options should be used with caution. If you fail to pay any home equity loans or lines of credit, you'll put your home at risk. Gary Hemming, owner and finance director of ABC Finance, also warns of a risk known as equity lock. “If neighborhood property values dip, even slightly, lenders can freeze your HELOC or deny a refinance, regardless of your credit score or payment history,” says Hemming. “You're left with large monthly payments, but no access to additional capital.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/home-equity-loan-vs-line-credit\">HELOC vs. Home Equity Loan: How To Decide</a></p><h3>Opt for other secured loans or lines of credit</h3><p>A secured loan uses an asset as collateral. Because your asset is tied to the loan, the lender's risk lowers, which usually gives you a better interest rate and higher borrowing limits than an unsecured loan.</p><p>Similar to home equity financing, lenders may offer a loan or line of credit secured by your savings account or investments like stocks, bonds, and ETFs (exchange-traded funds).</p><p>Secured financing also comes with the risk of losing your asset if you don't pay. You may also not be able to borrow the full amount of your asset. And if you use an investment portfolio as collateral, market downturns can impact your borrowing power. Eric Mangold, certified wealth strategist and founder of Argosy Wealth Management, says: “If the portfolio declines significantly due to a market downturn, and the portfolio value falls below what was borrowed, the borrower may be required to deposit additional funds or sell some of the portfolio.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265398":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265398","content":"<p>Federal student loans and private student loans have important differences that affect borrowers.

Longer terms and lower scores can lead to higher interest rates, while a credit score of 780 or higher and a shorter repayment period, like two or three years, may confer an APR under 10%.</p><h3>2. Fees</h3><p>Fees can easily increase the cost of your loan. “One lender may offer a lower rate or easier access to credit but then charge a fee to recoup those costs,” says Briscoe. You might see the following fees when comparing lenders:</p><ul><li><strong>Late fee:</strong> Late payment fees are fairly common for personal loans. Late fees vary by lender and may be a flat dollar amount or a small percentage of the late payment.</li><li><strong>Origination fee:</strong> Some lenders <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">charge an origination fee</a> to process your loan. It could be up to 15% of your borrowed amount, depending on the lender and your credit. If your loan has an origination fee, the lender may remove the amount of the fee from your loan funds upfront, reducing how much you receive.</li><li><strong>Prepayment penalty:</strong> A prepayment penalty is a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">fee for paying off a loan early</a>, usually as a percentage of your loan balance or a flat fee.

Consider some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\">alternatives to a personal loan</a> if you're not entirely sure it's the right move. Here are a few examples:</p><h3>Secured line of credit</h3><p>You can borrow money from a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pros-and-cons-of-personal-line-of-credit\">personal line of credit</a> up to your credit limit. Like a credit card, you can use your credit line as needed and only pay for what you borrow plus interest.</p><p>It's common for personal lines of credit up to $50,000 to be secured by an asset, like a savings account or stocks. This collateral backs your loan and guarantees repayment, which can lower your borrowing risk to a lender. In turn, secured lines of credit generally have lower APRs than loans.</p><p>First Tech Federal Credit Union has stock-secured lines of credit between $25,000 and $500,000.</p><h3>Home equity options</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">Home equity loans</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity lines of credit</a>, or HELOCs, let you borrow money against the equity in your home.</p><p>A home equity loan is a lump sum repaid in monthly installments, similar to a personal loan. A HELOC is a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money as needed. Lenders usually allow you to borrow up to 80% of your home's equity with either type.</p><p>Expect interest rates to be lower for home equity borrowing options than personal loans because using your home as collateral lowers your borrowing risk. They also offer longer repayment terms of up to 20 or 30 years. But, if you fail to make payments, you could risk losing your home.</p><h3>401(k) loans</h3><p>Loans you take out against your 401(k) retirement plan are backed by the cash value of your account and don't require a credit check, making them an option if you have bad credit or don't want a lender placing a hard inquiry on your credit report.</p><p>These loans can be up to $50,000, but you can only borrow up to 50% of your vested amount. However, taking such a large chunk of your retirement could delay your retirement for years.&nbsp;</p><p>When you take a <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\">401(k) loan</a>, those funds are no longer earning a return or benefiting from compound interest or gains. A 401(k) loan can be particularly disastrous if you don't pay it back. In this case, it's treated as a withdrawal, which means you'll owe tax on the unpaid amount plus a 10% penalty tax if you're under 59 ½.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264958":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264958","content":"<p><strong>Compare:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan-vs-personal-loan\">401(k) Loan vs. Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264962":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264962","content":"<p><i><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Some lending partners that participate in Credible’s comparison marketplace offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 550.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

In turn, secured lines of credit generally have lower APRs than loans.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">First Tech Federal Credit Union has stock-secured lines of credit between $25,000 and $500,000.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Home equity options</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Home equity loans</a> and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="heloc-vs-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">home equity lines of credit</a>, or HELOCs, let you borrow money against the equity in your home.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A home equity loan is a lump sum repaid in monthly installments, similar to a personal loan. A HELOC is a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money as needed. Lenders usually allow you to borrow up to 80% of your home&#x27;s equity with either type.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Expect interest rates to be lower for home equity borrowing options than personal loans because using your home as collateral lowers your borrowing risk. They also offer longer repayment terms of up to 20 or 30 years. But, if you fail to make payments, you could risk losing your home.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">401(k) loans</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Loans you take out against your 401(k) retirement plan are backed by the cash value of your account and don&#x27;t require a credit check, making them an option if you have bad credit or don&#x27;t want a lender placing a hard inquiry on your credit report.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">These loans can be up to $50,000, but you can only borrow up to 50% of your vested amount. However, taking such a large chunk of your retirement could delay your retirement for years. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When you take a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="401k-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">401(k) loan</a>, those funds are no longer earning a return or benefiting from compound interest or gains. A 401(k) loan can be particularly disastrous if you don&#x27;t pay it back. In this case, it&#x27;s treated as a withdrawal, which means you&#x27;ll owe tax on the unpaid amount plus a 10% penalty tax if you&#x27;re under 59 ½.</p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_pin__z_PTM"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAgCAYAAAAbifjMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAD9SURBVHgB7ZQxTsMwFIb/P6YREksFF4jKRDZuULaOXTOVlgMgTgBchFbKCZhgI9ygA3SEHADRzFC/hz2UoaVScDvmW2w/+f/kwe8BW8L5qHOt4A3+T0mxp1Fg2JPYyPQjt6kQiFE73xPBMCIuFxaJCJM6wbilhZLPh+PynsvirHcyATmoI0gfZr+5CFvSCBrBTgT8uDjuUzGw3+yKsl0nFLfE9YJOj+7ervg56rw7T4IABK4RQ8NL/EC5RQiqUyO24Gr9pZeeu/kwXg+wSB9fz9ZesFoQagVFuYj3q6+DNvzqz/D1PyA2kOd51xjzRHKSZdlw073mKzeCnQh+AIFqUAFq25YWAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="pin Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_pinImg__6k6q1"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_pinTitle__dnoCL styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Caution</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">If you leave the job your 401(k) plan is through, you may need to pay your loan in full.</p></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Compare:</strong> <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="401k-loan-vs-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">401(k) Loan vs. Personal Loan</a></p></section><h2 class="styles_faqTitle__eAyrU large bold secondary700" id="faq">FAQ</h2><div data-test-id="collapse" class="styles_collapse__1HbGr styles_faq__rnWB3"><div class="styles_title__Yyp_j collapse__title"><div class="collapse-title"><div class="styles_label__v7T5z"><h3 class="styles_title__8dlhn styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb">Is a $50K personal loan a smart idea?</h3><p class="styles_openCloseLabel__sbTQF styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb styles_lighter__9PAOr">Open</p></div></div></div><div style="overflow:hidden;height:0px;visibility:hidden" class="collapse-css-transition"><div class="ReactCollapse--content"><div class="styles_innerContent__Es6Bs"><p color="lighter" class="styles_faqContent___TpEl"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A $50,000 personal loan can be a good idea if you need to cover a major expense, like home renovations or high-interest debt consolidation, and can comfortably afford the payments.

During deferment, for instance, some loan types won't accrue interest, while all loan types accrue interest during forbearance. The other major difference is that interest capitalizes after a deferment, but it doesn't capitalize after a forbearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are two types of \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forbearance\"\u003estudent loan forbearance\u003c/a\u003e: mandatory and general. A student loan servicer is required to grant mandatory forbearance if you meet the requirements, which include serving in an AmeriCorps position and completing a medical or dental residency program, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGeneral forbearance is available for borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship or facing major medical expenses, but it's up to the discretion of your loan servicer. Forbearance periods usually span up to 12 months at a time, but you may qualify for a cumulative total of three years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeferment is typically the superior option to forbearance if you have subsidized loans or Perkins Loans due to the interest subsidy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePros and cons of deferring student loans\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeferring student loans has both pros and cons that are worth considering before you apply. On the pro side, deferment can help you through a financial rough patch, as it allows you to pause payments without having to worry about late fees or delinquency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt's also available for a variety of circumstances, including serving in the Peace Corps, experiencing unemployment, or undergoing treatment for cancer. What's more, some types of student loans won't accrue interest during deferment, so you won't have to worry about your balance growing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, some student loans will accrue interest during this time, which can increase your cost of borrowing. If you don't pay that interest during your deferment, it capitalizes. You also won't be making any progress toward loan repayment, so you'll be in debt for longer. And you won't be making progress toward loan forgiveness if you're pursuing a program like \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\"\u003ePublic Service Loan Forgiveness\u003c/a\u003e (PSLF).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore pursuing deferment, consider alternative options for adjusting your student loan payments, such as an \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\"\u003eincome-driven repayment\u003c/a\u003e (IDR) plan.

Consider some\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\"\u003ealternatives to a personal loan\u003c/a\u003e if you're not entirely sure it's the right move. Here are a few examples:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSecured line of credit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can borrow money from a \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/pros-and-cons-of-personal-line-of-credit\"\u003epersonal line of credit\u003c/a\u003e up to your credit limit. Like a credit card, you can use your credit line as needed and only pay for what you borrow plus interest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt's common for personal lines of credit up to $50,000 to be secured by an asset, like a savings account or stocks. This collateral backs your loan and guarantees repayment, which can lower your borrowing risk to a lender. In turn, secured lines of credit generally have lower APRs than loans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst Tech Federal Credit Union has stock-secured lines of credit between $25,000 and $500,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHome equity options\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\"\u003eHome equity loans\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\"\u003ehome equity lines of credit\u003c/a\u003e, or HELOCs, let you borrow money against the equity in your home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA home equity loan is a lump sum repaid in monthly installments, similar to a personal loan. A HELOC is a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money as needed. Lenders usually allow you to borrow up to 80% of your home's equity with either type.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExpect interest rates to be lower for home equity borrowing options than personal loans because using your home as collateral lowers your borrowing risk. They also offer longer repayment terms of up to 20 or 30 years. But, if you fail to make payments, you could risk losing your home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e401(k) loans\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoans you take out against your 401(k) retirement plan are backed by the cash value of your account and don't require a credit check, making them an option if you have bad credit or don't want a lender placing a hard inquiry on your credit report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese loans can be up to $50,000, but you can only borrow up to 50% of your vested amount. However, taking such a large chunk of your retirement could delay your retirement for years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you take a \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\"\u003e401(k) loan\u003c/a\u003e, those funds are no longer earning a return or benefiting from compound interest or gains. A 401(k) loan can be particularly disastrous if you don't pay it back. In this case, it's treated as a withdrawal, which means you'll owe tax on the unpaid amount plus a 10% penalty tax if you're under 59 ½.\u003c/p\u003e"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264958":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264958","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompare:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan-vs-personal-loan\"\u003e401(k) Loan vs. Personal Loan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:264962":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"264962","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclosure:\u003c/strong\u003e Some lending partners that participate in Credible’s comparison marketplace offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 550.
