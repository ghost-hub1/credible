It's better than “poor” but is not considered “good.” Nationwide, the average FICO score is 715.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-check-credit-score\">improve your credit score</a> to fall in the higher range of the fair category, you'll have a better chance of qualifying for a loan.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you get a personal loan with a 600 credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You may be able to get a personal loan with a 600 credit score from lenders that cater to fair-credit borrowers. To improve your odds, find lenders that have a <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirement</a> lower than or equal to your score.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some lenders, like Upstart, use AI-assisted underwriting to make loans more available to borrowers with compromised credit and to underserved communities.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much can I borrow with a 600 credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The loan amount you can borrow is based on a variety of factors including your credit score, your income, your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI), the lender's loan limits, and more. The best way to estimate how much a lender will let you borrow is to request a quote.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does a personal loan hurt your credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Getting a personal loan can cause an initial drop in your credit score with subsequent gains if managed wisely. A hard inquiry for new credit, a new account on your report, and an increase in the amounts you owe could all bring your score down.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if you use the loan to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/consolidate-credit-card-debt\">consolidate credit card debt</a>, you could see quick and significant gains once those cards are paid off. And over time, the loan can help your score as you build a track record of on-time payments.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are personal loans used for?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The beauty of personal loans is that they can be used for a number of purposes, with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-cant-you-use-a-personal-loan-for\">few exceptions</a>. But not all lenders will approve all loan purposes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You'll need to specify what you want to use the loan for when you apply. Some common uses include funding home renovations, <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency expenses</a>, debt consolidation, moving expenses, weddings, funerals, and medical bills.</p>"}}]}

To receive the grant, you must meet eligibility criteria and agree to teach full-time for at least 4 years in a high-need field at an eligible school or educational service agency.

If that's the case, consider looking into the following alternatives:</p><h3>Fellowships and assistantships</h3><p>Graduate fellowships and assistantships both provide financial support to graduate students, but they have some key differences.</p><p>A <strong>fellowship</strong> offers a living stipend to graduate students who demonstrate academic excellence, but it's not a form of employment. Instead, graduate schools often use fellowships to incentivize students to complete their program there. You can think of a fellowship as a merit-based award. Fellowships can come from a university, private foundation, or local, state, or federal agency.</p><p><strong>Assistantships</strong>, on the other hand, allow grad students to earn money in exchange for teaching or conducting research. An assistantship can offer a monthly salary and tuition waiver, and may cover institutional fees and health insurance.</p><h3>Employer tuition assistance</h3><p>Many employers offer tuition assistance (paying for courses up front) or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">reimbursement</a> (paying you back for your course costs) to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. If you're working full- or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/part-time-student-loans\">part-time</a> to put yourself through grad school, reach out to your employer to find out if it offers educational assistance. Companies can offer up to $5,250 per employee each year tax-free.</p><h3>Private student loans</h3><p>In situations where federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/graduate-student-loans\">student loans for grad students</a> and other forms of financial aid fall short, it may be worth considering private student loans as a way to bridge the gap.

Once you've met all the requirements, any remaining amount due on your student loans will be eliminated, and you won't have to pay the money back.&nbsp;</p><p>“Student loan forgiveness will help your day-to-day finances by eliminating monthly payments,” says Domenick D'Andrea, an accredited investment fiduciary and co-founder of DanDarah Wealth Management. “It will also help lower your debt-to-income ratio, which can help you get new credit if needed or potentially lower rates through refinancing.”</p><h2>Important changes coming in 2026</h2><p>Most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/get-student-loan-forgiveness\">student loan forgiveness programs</a> start with signing up for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. IDR plans set payments at a percentage of income.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you’ve signed up, you can qualify for forgiveness either by participating in Public Service Loan Forgiveness or by making a certain number of payments on your IDR plan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, big changes are coming to IDR plans in 2026. Specifically:</p><ul><li>If you’re a new borrower after July 1, 2026, you’ll only have one income-driven repayment plan option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). You’ll have to choose between RAP and the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have existing student loans and don’t take out any new loans after July 1, 2026, you’ll continue to have access to a selection of IDR plans, including Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). The IBR Plan will no longer require financial hardship.&nbsp;</li><li>PAYE and ICR are being fully phased out after July 1, 2028. If you were an existing borrower before July 1, 2026, you can switch to IBR prior to the July 2028 deadline to remain on this plan. Otherwise, you’ll be switched to RAP.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Because the IDR plans are changing, your monthly payments and your timeline for eligibility for loan forgiveness may change.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324806":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324806","content":"<h2>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h2><p>Participating in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> program is one of the fastest ways to get your student debt discharged. You’re eligible for PSLF if:</p><ul><li>You’re employed full-time by a qualifying employer, including a nonprofit or the government, such as federal, state, local, and tribal governments.</li><li>You have Direct Loans or have consolidated other eligible federal loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan.</li><li>You’re repaying your loans under an income-driven plan.</li><li>You make 120 qualifying on-time payments.</li></ul><p>Your employer will need to certify your employment for your loans to be forgiven. Because the available IDR plans are changing soon, you may need to switch to a different repayment plan as you work toward making your 120 qualifying on-time payments.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education also imposed new restrictions on qualifying employment, making clear that you cannot qualify for PSLF if you are working for “organizations that engage in unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose, including supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration.”</p><p>Some critics have argued that the restriction could be applied in a politically influenced manner and unfairly block some organizations from qualifying for forgiveness.</p><h2>Income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness</h2><p>IDR plans are another popular way to qualify for loan forgiveness. These options allow borrowers to set payments at a specific percentage of income, and then any balance that remains at the end of the required repayment period is forgiven.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are three active IDR plans and one plan that has been suspended by the courts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\"><strong>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If you first borrowed after July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years. If you first borrowed before July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 15% of discretionary income, and remaining balances are forgiven after 25 years.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pay as You Earn (PAYE):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and forgiveness is available after 20 years. Payments must be less than the amount due under the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are set at the lesser of 20% of income or the amount you'd pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over the course of 12 years, adjusted based on income. Forgiveness is available after 25 years.&nbsp; This plan is currently the only option parents with PLUS loans can qualify for, but they must consolidate first.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE):</strong>&nbsp;The courts have blocked the SAVE Plan, so borrowers can’t enroll in this plan.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Anyone who borrowed before July 1, 2026, can choose between IBR, PAYE, and ICR, provided they don't take out any new loans. However, PAYE and ICR are going away after July 1, 2028, and borrowers on one of these plans will need to change to IBR before that date or will be put on the new Repayment Assistance Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>The partial financial hardship requirement for the IBR Plan is being eliminated, and parents with loans issued before July 1, 2028, can consolidate to become eligible for IBR as long as the consolidation is completed before the deadline and they enroll in ICR (including making one payment) immediately before enrolling in IBR.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Repayment Assistance Plan is the only IDR plan that will be available to new borrowers after July 1, 2026. Borrowers with older loans can also choose to switch to RAP.</p><p>RAP calculates payments based on adjusted gross income (AGI) instead of discretionary income. Payments on the RAP plan are between 1% and 10% of AGI, but there’s an annual minimum payment of $120. When payments don't fully cover monthly interest, unpaid interest is canceled so your balance doesn't increase. Any remaining balance after 30 years is forgiven.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:16110":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"16110","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324810":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324810","content":"<h2>Profession-based forgiveness programs</h2><p>There are also loan forgiveness programs available for people in certain professions.

Many organizations offer scholarships specifically for beauty students, such as the Great Clips Great Scholarship Program and the Keller Cosmetology Scholarship. Some schools even offer scholarship opportunities of their own.</p><p>“The main benefit of receiving a scholarship is that you do not have to pay that money back. [Make sure] to check with your institution to identify what scholarships they might offer, and be sure to check out <a href=\"https://beautychangeslives.org/\">www.beautychangeslives.org</a>,” says Worthen.</p><h3>Work part-time to lower costs</h3><p>Balancing school with a part-time job can help reduce your reliance on student loans. If you can, look for work in the beauty industry — gaining experience while you're in school can lead to job opportunities after graduation. Some employers even offer tuition assistance programs, which can help cover the cost of your education while you work.</p><h3>Start making loan payments while in school</h3><p>Student loans often come with the option to delay repayment until after graduation, but interest continues to add up while you're in school. If possible, try to make small payments while you're in school to help keep your loan balance from growing. Many lenders allow interest-only payments while you're enrolled, which can prevent interest from <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">capitalizing</a> and reduce what you owe in the long term. Turning on autopay, if your lender offers it, can also lower your interest rate by about 0.25 percentage points.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15734":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15734","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:317666":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"317666","content":"<h2>Why you can trust our Credible experts</h2><p>The Credible editorial team is independent and unbiased.

Before applying, review your budget to see how much discretionary income you have and how much you're willing to put toward a monthly loan payment.</p><p>Identify your target monthly payment as well as the maximum you're willing to pay per month.

Just bear in mind that the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a> you're approved for could limit how much you can borrow.

Most items only stay on credit reports for 7 years. If negative marks are going to drop off soon, score improvements will likely follow.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If you have a close friend or family member willing to make you an authorized user on their credit card, you could see a boost in your own score within a month — as long as they make on-time monthly payments and maintain a low or zero balance.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate.

Most items only stay on credit reports for 7 years.
