Borrowers can also extend their grace period up to an additional six months.

When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible. Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments.

If you or your cosigner has an account with Citizens Bank, you can reduce your rate by 0.25 percentage points. Another 0.25 percentage points can be shaved off by enrolling in automatic payments, giving you the chance to lower your rate by up to 0.5 percentage points.","review":{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4.3,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dori Zinn"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json" data-next-head="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"College Ave","description":"College Ave offers student loans for almost every type of degree program, with a range of repayment options, including a unique 8-year repayment term.

The residency requirement might be waived if you inherited the property.</li><li><strong>On-time mortgage payments:</strong> If you currently have a mortgage on the property, you must have paid your most recent 12 months’ payments during the month they were due.</li><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> The minimum <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/credit-score-needed-to-refinance-house\">credit score</a> for all FHA loans is 500.

Conventional cash-out refinance loans have no government backing, so the standards may vary by lender. However, most conventional loans can be purchased by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, private companies that operate under government supervision and regulation. These entities set minimum standards for the conventional loans they purchase. Loans that conform to those standards are called conforming loans.</p><h3>Types of properties you can refinance</h3><p>Conventional refinance loans are more flexible in several ways, including the type of property you can refinance.</p><p>“FHA loans are for primary residences only, and conventional loans are for primary residences, second homes, and investment properties,” Reinford says.</p><h3>Loan limits</h3><p>Conventional loan maximums follow national <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/conforming-loans\">conforming loan limits</a>. The current conforming limit is $766,550.&nbsp;</p><p>The FHA limit for low-cost areas is 65% of the conforming limit, or $498,257 for a one-family home.</p><p>In high-cost areas, the FHA loan limit increases to 150% of the national conforming limit. The FHA maximum for these areas is $1,149,825. The FHA makes further adjustments for special exception areas, where the current limit is $1,724,725.</p><h3>Residency requirements</h3><p>At least one FHA cash-out refinance borrower for a particular loan must have owned the home and lived in it as their primary home for 12 months or longer.&nbsp;</p><p>For conventional cash-out refinances, a first mortgage being refinanced must be at least 12 months old, and at least one of the borrowers must have lived in the home as their primary residence for at least six months.</p><p>Both loan types allow exceptions for situations such as inherited properties and properties acquired in a divorce.</p><h3>Credit requirements</h3><p>Conventional cash-out refinance loans require a 620 credit score. FHA borrowers, on the other hand, can qualify with a score as low as 500, although the lender that originates the loan might require higher scores.</p><h3>Maximum loan-to-value ratio</h3><p>The maximum <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/loan-to-value-ratio-refinancing\">LTV</a> for conventional cash-out refi loans is 80% for a single-family primary residence.

You might be eligible with a higher DTI if you meet additional requirements, such as having at least six months’ worth of cash reserves.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mortgage insurance</h3><p>Most FHA loans, including cash-out refinance loans, require a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-mortgage-insurance\">mortgage insurance premium</a> (MIP). The upfront MIP costs 1.75% of the loan amount. In addition, you’ll pay an annual premium of 0.11% to 0.50%, depending on your LTV.

This means families may want to start planning for the FAFSA as early as their student's freshman year of high school.</p><h3>Minimize your taxable income</h3><p>Since schools use the taxable income and assets that you report on the FAFSA to determine your eligibility for need-based aid, it's important to consider your financial moves during the FAFSA reporting years.</p><p>This is something families can overlook, according to Wang. “Maybe a family has an old 401(k) that they cash in to pay for kitchen renovations. What they forget is that cashing in a 401(k) shows as income, which goes on the tax return, and eventually goes on the FAFSA,” he says.</p><h3>Correctly report your financial information</h3><p>Accurate reporting of your income and assets is the only way to ensure you receive the aid you're eligible for. And the Federal Student Aid office takes incorrect and fraudulent financial information seriously. If you receive financial aid based on false financial information, you'll have to pay back the money you received and may face fines and penalties.</p><p>The good news is that there are a number of assets you're not required to include in the FAFSA. You don't need to report the following:</p><ul><li>Equity in your primary home</li><li>Life insurance values</li><li>ABLE accounts</li><li>Retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, pension funds, annuities, non-education IRAs, etc.</li></ul><h3>Double-check your FAFSA answers</h3><p>There are some common mistakes that can derail the processing of your FAFSA. It can be easy to transpose digits in your Social Security number or make a spelling mistake while you're typing quickly.</p><p>Wang also cautions that it can be very easy to miss the prepopulated extra 0 in some FAFSA financial fields. “Entering a number sometimes does not override the zero there,” Wang says. “Instead, it adds a zero to the number entered. For example, entering $100 can mistakenly be entered as $1,000.” This could lead to the mistaken reporting of your financial information.</p><h3>Explore state and school-based aid programs</h3><p>Your state of residence and the schools you apply to may also have financial aid for which you could be eligible. Make sure you look into these aid programs to determine your eligibility.</p><h2>What to do if your FAFSA award isn't enough</h2><p>Your FAFSA award may not cover all of your educational expenses. There are several ways to bridge the gap between your financial aid award and the cost of attendance:</p><ul><li><strong>Appeal the financial aid decision:</strong> You can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/financial-aid-appeal-letter?aid=898409&amp;label=affnetawin-index_pub-264419_site-_pname-FlexOffers.com%2C%20LLC_plc-_ts-156178.6776.0FOF42700524907142458_clkid-6776_1713706024_58564136aea582aefa4135702cec8edb&amp;sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=264419&amp;awc=6776_1713706024_58564136aea582aefa4135702cec8edb&amp;utm_source=affnetawin&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_term=index&amp;utm_content=264419\">appeal the award decision</a> from your school if you believe you should be eligible for a more favorable financial aid package. You should be able to provide a reason to justify your request for more aid, and you'll likely need to include supporting documentation. For example, you may consider appealing the decision if your family has experienced something like a job loss or unreimbursed medical expenses.</li><li><strong>Apply for scholarships and other funding sources:</strong> There's no limit to the amount of money you can receive through scholarships or private grants. Finding and applying for these funding options can be an excellent way to pay for your education.</li><li><strong>Consider private student loan options:</strong> Although private student loans don't have the borrower protections offered by federal student loans, they can offer a way to cover the difference between your federal aid award and the cost of college.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors.

The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost.

The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month.

However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment.

APRs are generally capped at 36% and repayment terms often range between 1 and 7 years.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps</strong> offer a short-term, small-loan funding solution.

If you're using a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">loan to consolidate debt</a>, you can check to see if your lender can send payments directly to your creditors.

Loans may have lower interest rates and fewer fees. Plus approval will not require a hard credit check. Just be sure to clarify the loan's terms, including interest rate, fees, monthly payment amounts, due dates, and a repayment schedule in writing. If borrowing more than $10,000, check IRS rules to make sure your lender is charging a sufficient interest rate.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\">9 Personal Loan Alternatives</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:208470":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"208470","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/where-can-i-get-a-bad-credit-loan\"><i>Where Can I Get a Bad Credit Loan?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/how-to-choose-the-best-bad-credit-loan-lender\"><i>How to Choose the Best Bad Credit Loan Lender</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\"><i>Co-applicant vs. Cosigner: What's the Difference?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/500-credit-score-loan\"><i>How and Where To Get a 500 Credit Score Loan</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/550-credit-score-loan\"><i>Personal Loan With a 550 Credit Score: Can I Get One?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/ways-to-get-an-emergency-loan-with-bad-credit\"><i>Ways to Get an Emergency Loan with Bad Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Fair Credit</i></a></li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:283410":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"283410","content":"<p>Credible works with multiple <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">lenders</a> that consider borrowers with a 600 credit score.

Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO credit score, the largest factor. Late payments count against you and stay on your record for 7 years.</li><li><strong>Keep credit utilization low</strong>: If you have revolving credit lines like credit cards, keep the balances as low as possible. Aim for no greater than 30% credit utilization.

If negative marks are going to drop off soon, score improvements will likely follow.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If you have a close friend or family member willing to make you an authorized user on their credit card, you could see a boost in your own score within a month — as long as they make on-time monthly payments and maintain a low or zero balance.

These grants don’t have to be repaid, and you can receive one for each year that you’re in school (up to six years).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\"><strong>Federal Work Study</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Both undergraduate and graduate students with financial need may qualify for work study, which provides part-time employment to help them earn extra money for school. Work study income doesn’t have to be repaid, but does have to be earned through employment.</li><li><strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG):</strong>&nbsp;This program offers grants to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Grants are administered by the financial aid offices at each participating school.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\"><strong>Income-driven repayment</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Once you graduate, you can sign up for an income-driven repayment plan, which adjusts your monthly loan payments based on your income. Your payments will be limited to a certain percentage of your discretionary income. Very low-income borrowers could pay as little as $0 per month.</li></ul><h2>Private student loans for low-income students</h2><p>Low-income students may also want to turn to private student loans if federal loans don't go far enough.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some students might still have a gap after exhausting their annual borrowing limit for federal loans,” says Angela Colatriano, chief operating officer of College Ave. “For example, a student can typically borrow up to $5,500 in federal loans in their freshman year. For students who still have a gap to cover after exhausting federal aid and other need or merit-based grants and scholarships,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> can help cover the remaining cost.”</p><p>Private lenders generally require a sufficient and stable income to qualify for loans. They also require a credit check to ensure you’re a responsible borrower. Unfortunately, many low-income students won’t meet these requirements on their own, especially fresh out of high school. However, you can apply with a cosigner who meets the income and credit requirements.</p><p>While private loans can be an excellent supplement to federal loans, it’s also important to minimize your borrowing so you don’t overburden yourself after graduation. Colatriano recommends analyzing your financial situation to understand how much you feel comfortable borrowing.&nbsp;</p><p>“For students planning to borrow, be sure to understand what repayment will look like after graduation,” says Colatriano. “A helpful guideline is to borrow less in total than what you expect to earn in your first year after graduation. By doing so, you can typically be on track to pay off your loans in around 10 years.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15718":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15718","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:315302":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"315302","content":"<h2>How to qualify for financial aid as a low-income student</h2><p>The first step to qualifying for any federal financial aid is to complete the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-does-fafsa-work\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>.

You may still need additional funding sources.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to consider</h2><p>Although interest-free loans are relatively rare, there are several alternatives you can explore to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-pay-for-college\">help you pay for college</a> without overpaying in interest.</p><h3>Private grants and scholarships</h3><p>College <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> don't have to be repaid, making them an even better option than interest-free loans. There's no limit to how many you can receive, so applying for multiple awards can help reduce your need for student loans. Start your search with resources like <a href=\"https://www.fastweb.com/\">Fastweb</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scholarships.com/\">Scholarships.com</a>, and the Department of Labor's free <a href=\"https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx\">scholarship search tool</a>.</p><h3>Employer educational assistance programs</h3><p>Many large companies, including Starbucks, Amazon, and Target, offer tuition reimbursement programs to help employees cover college costs. Some employers also contribute toward student loan repayment. Through Dec. 31, 2025, companies can provide up to $5,250 per year tax-free for education expenses or student loan payments. Any amount beyond this is considered taxable income.</p><h3>Federal work-study</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study program</a> provides part-time jobs for students with financial need. Jobs are typically on campus or with approved off-campus organizations, and often align with your field of study or community service.

Partners do not influence our editorial content. To help you find the best student loan for your situation, we conduct thorough research and analyze thousands of lender data points. Using data-driven methodologies, we score criteria that are important to you. This allows us to objectively rank student loan lenders and products. To learn more, read our methodology below.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>To determine the best <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">small private student loan lenders</a>, Credible collected more than 1,000 points of data on two dozen companies and evaluated them on several different categories: repayment options, eligibility, interest rates, loan terms, and customer support. We assigned a score out of five stars to each lender based on our findings. Below are the weightings assigned to the general categories for the best student loan companies — which comprise individual criteria that are also weighted.</p><ul><li><strong>Repayment options:</strong> 30%</li><li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> 25%</li><li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> 20%</li><li><strong>Loan terms:</strong> 15%</li><li><strong>Customer support:</strong> 10%</li></ul><p>While the best lender for you will depend on your unique needs and financial circumstances, these findings should help answer your questions and assist you in your search for the best student loan.</p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/lender-review-methodology\">our methodology</a>.</p><h2>What is the minimum student loan amount?</h2><p>Federal student loans don't have a minimum loan amount. However, if your school determines that you qualify for a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">Direct Subsidized Loan</a> of $200 or less, it can choose to include that amount in a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">Direct Unsubsidized Loan</a> instead.</p><p>Minimum amounts for private student loans vary by lender, but are often $1,000 or $2,000. If you're unsure of a private lender's minimum loan amount, contact the lender before applying.</p><h2>Student loan limits for the 2025-26 school year</h2><p>Both federal and private student loans come with student loan limits that determine the maximum amount you can borrow. But if you only want a small student loan and are approved for a higher loan amount, you’re free to accept just the amount you want — you don’t have to take the full amount you’re offered.</p><p>And private student loans can be limited based on your credit (or your cosigner’s credit) and income.</p><p>Here are the limits you can expect:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:239306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"239306","content":"<h2>How to minimize student loan borrowing</h2><p>It's best to limit your borrowing, as you must repay all student loans plus interest. You can minimize the amount you take out in student loans using these strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Maximize gift aid: </strong>Gift aid is money that doesn't have to be repaid, such as scholarships and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>. Maximizing gift aid opportunities allows you to borrow less and save more. In addition to gift aid, take advantage of the federal work-study program if you qualify. With work-study, you can apply for a part-time job on or off campus and use the funds to cover education expenses.</li><li><strong>Consider living at home: </strong>Living at home with your parents rather than on campus can help you save thousands of dollars. Consider commuting to school if you'll be attending college locally.</li><li><strong>Take AP classes in high school: </strong>You can test out of general education college classes by passing<strong> </strong>Advanced Placement (AP) exams in high school, therefore reducing the number of classes you must take. Just keep in mind that not all colleges accept AP class credits, so you'll need to find out if your school will allow you to test out of courses.</li></ul><h2>How to take out a small student loan</h2><p>If you’re ready to take out a small private student loan, follow these four steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Fill out the FAFSA: </strong>If you need to pay for college, your first step should be completing the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/register-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>. Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine what federal student loans and other federal financial aid you’re eligible for.</li><li><strong>Apply for scholarships and grants: </strong>Unlike student loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">college scholarships</a> and grants don’t have to be repaid — which makes them a great way to cover education costs. There’s no limit to how many you can get, so it’s a good idea to apply for as many scholarships and grants as you can.</li><li><strong>Take out federal student loans: </strong>If you need to borrow for school, it’s usually best to start with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">federal student loans</a> as they come with federal benefits and protections — such as access to a variety of repayment options and forgiveness programs. After you’ve filled out the FAFSA, your school will send you a financial aid award letter detailing what federal student loans and other federal financial aid you qualify for. You can then decide what aid — and how much — you’d like to accept.</li><li><strong>Use private student loans to fill in the gaps: </strong>Once you’ve exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options, private student loans can help you fill any financial gaps left over. These loans can range from as little as $1,000 up to your school’s cost of attendance (depending on the lender).</li></ol><h2>Taking out a student loan with bad credit</h2><p>You’ll generally need good to excellent credit to qualify for a private student loan. While there are several lenders that offer student loans for bad credit, these loans tend to come with higher interest rates compared to good credit loans.</p><p>If you don’t meet private student loan requirements on your own, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">applying with a cosigner</a> might help you get approved more easily. Even if you don’t need a cosigner to qualify, having one could get you a lower interest rate than you’d get alone.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:239310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"239310","content":"<p>No matter which type of student loan you get, it’s important to consider how much that loan will cost you in the future. This way, you can be prepared for any added expenses.</p><h2>Other ways to pay for college</h2><p>Student loans aren’t the only way to pay for college. Here are a few other options to consider that could help you keep your student loan debt low:</p><ul><li><strong>Check if a 529 plan was opened for you: </strong>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-529-plan\">529 plan</a> is a type of college savings account that helps parents save on taxes while putting away money for their child’s education. If your parents (or even your grandparents) have a 529 plan for you, you can use the money for your qualified education expenses. Keep in mind that a 529 plan held by your parent could affect your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-calculate-your-student-loan-expected-family-contribution-efc\">Student Aid Index</a>, that’s calculated through the FAFSA — meaning you might not be offered as much financial aid.</li><li><strong>Start at a community college: </strong>Attending a community college can be much less expensive compared to a traditional four-year school. To help keep your costs low, it could be a good idea to start at a community college, then transfer to a four-year school to finish your degree.</li><li><strong>Apply for a work-study job: </strong>After filling out the FAFSA, you might have the option to apply for a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">work-study program</a>. Jobs offered through this program generally don't pay very much, but they can help you cover small costs while also adding to your resume.</li><li><strong>Get a part-time job: </strong>Another alternative is to get a job that can help you pay for expenses while you’re taking classes. Just be sure to find something that won’t interfere with your coursework.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:239314":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"239314","content":"<h2>Small private student loans can help fill in funding gaps</h2><p>A small private student loan can fill in funding gaps after you’ve exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options.

Plus, you can lengthen your repayment term by five years, which can be helpful if you need to lower your monthly payments or request a hardship forbearance for 12 months.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Offers 2% loan reduction after graduation</li><li>Doesn’t charge late fees</li><li>Can reduce interest rate by making on-time payments</li><li>Possible repayment term and grace period extension</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t offer parent loans</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Interest rates</p><div><p>Fixed or variable</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum credit score</p><div><p>660</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum income</p><div><p>$1 (must have positive income)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan terms</p><div><p>5, 7, 10, 15, or 20 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amounts</p><div><p>$1,000 up to school-certified cost of attendance (for undergrad loans; $350,000 for graduate loans)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Cosigner release</p><div><p>Available after 12 monthly principal and interest payment</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments. However, cosigners on loans for international students do not qualify.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Doesn’t charge application fees or origination fees</li><li>Offers discounts of 0.50 to 1 percentage points when making automatic payments</li><li>Can get a 1% cash-back reward after you graduate</li><li>Grace periods from 9 to 36 months</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>May find lower interest rates with some competitors</li><li>International students don’t have option to release cosigners</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Interest rates</p><div><p>Fixed or variable</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum credit score</p><div><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum income</p><div><p>$30,000 for most loans</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan terms</p><div><p>5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or 20 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amounts</p><div><p>$2,001 minimum up to your school’s annual cost of attendance; lifetime limits of $200,000 for undergrads and $400,000 for graduates</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Cosigner release</p><div><p>12 months</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must be a U.S. citizen or DACA student enrolled at least half time at an eligible institution.

If you or your cosigner has an account with Citizens Bank, you can reduce your rate by 0.25 percentage points.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments.
