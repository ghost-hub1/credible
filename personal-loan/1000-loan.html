Some personal loan lenders also offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">no-credit-check personal loans</a>, but all of these options are likely to come with a high APR.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Payday alternative loans, or PALs, can be a better alternative, as they will check your credit but often make lending decisions based on your relationship with the credit union rather than credit scores.&nbsp;</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I get a $1,000 loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A PAL from a federal credit union can be a good option for a $1,000 loan if you have bad credit, as they have <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-low-interest-loan\">lower interest rates</a> and fees than many of the other options available, and often make lending decisions based on their relationship with you rather than just your credit score.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other lenders may offer $1,000 loans to borrowers with bad credit, but often charge high interest and fees as well.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You might be able to get approved for a loan with bad credit (a FICO score under 580), but it could be difficult. Lenders determine your ability to repay a loan based on your creditworthiness, and a low score indicates you’re a risk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind, if you’re approved for a bad-credit loan, you may be charged an origination fee or offered a high APR. A cosigner can help lower these costs or increase your chances of approval.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does applying for a loan hurt your credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Applying for a personal loan can temporarily hurt your credit score. Once you apply, the lender will run a hard credit check, which can ding your credit score by a few points (typically, no more than five). Hard inquiries typically affect your credit score for up to one year, but can stay on your report for two years. Plus, if you make on-time payments and practice good credit habits, you could see your credit score bounce back relatively quickly.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What personal loan term length should I choose?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The personal loan term length you should choose depends on how much you can afford, what you want your monthly payments to be, and how long you want to pay back the loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A longer loan term will increase how long you pay off the loan and how much you’ll pay in interest while lowering your monthly payments. However, if you want to pay the least amount in interest, consider choosing a shorter repayment term.&nbsp;</p>"}}]}

Loan repayment periods vary depending on the size of the loan and its purpose.

Auto loans, student loans, and personal loans are usually smaller and paid over a shorter time frame, such as three to 10 years.</p><h2>How do loan terms affect the cost of credit?</h2><p>The loan term you choose affects more than just the amount of time you’re in debt. It also impacts your interest costs and monthly payments.</p><h3>Relationship between loan length and monthly payments</h3><p>Longer loan terms result in lower monthly payments because they’re spread over a longer period of time. Meanwhile, shorter-term loans condense your balance into fewer installments, increasing your monthly payments.</p><h3>Impact on total interest paid</h3><p>You’ll generally pay more interest with a longer loan term for two reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Longer payoff timeline: </strong>Lenders charge interest with each monthly payment, so a longer loan term naturally results in more interest payments.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>High interest rate: </strong>Higher rates on longer-term loans also increase your interest costs.

Then, “consider long-term goals like retirement and future income,” says Bruce McClary, senior vice president of communications and membership at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, McClary says, choose a shorter loan term if you want to shrink your interest costs. But if you can’t afford the higher payments, you could choose a longer term and pay more toward the principal when you’re able to.</p><h3>Income stability and future plans</h3><p>If your income fluctuates or you’re unsure about the future of your job, you might choose a longer loan term with lower monthly payments. This adds breathing room to your budget and provides flexibility during months when your income is low. On the other hand, you might be comfortable with a short loan term (and higher payments) if your cash flow is more stable.&nbsp;</p><h3>Potential changes in interest rates</h3><p>When interest rates are high, borrowers often look for ways to save money. One option is choosing a shorter loan term to qualify for a lower rate. If you do this, just make sure you’re comfortable with the higher payments.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to calculate the total cost of a loan</h2><p>To help you choose between loan terms, estimate the total interest paid over the loan duration. Here’s how to calculate the interest, payoff schedule, and other costs:</p><h3>Using loan calculators to estimate payments and interest</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">loan calculator</a> can help you estimate your monthly payment and total interest costs over the life of the loan.

Taking out a new loan can also shorten their average credit age and, if parents make late payments or go into default, this will damage their credit as well.</li></ul><h2>How to apply for a parent PLUS loan</h2><p>There are several steps involved in applying for a parent PLUS loan, including the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Obtain a Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID: </strong>Both the student and parent will need to create an FSA ID at StudentAid.gov. This will be important to complete the paperwork to obtain federal student aid.</li><li><strong>Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA): </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">FAFSA form</a> provides information to the Department of Education about your family’s personal and financial data. It's a prerequisite to get any type of federal aid and can be completed online on the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\">StudentAid.gov website</a>.</li><li><strong>Complete the Direct PLUS Loan application for parents: </strong>Parents must submit a separate application for a parent PLUS loan. This involves a credit check, and the entire process will take about 20 minutes. You can <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/plus-app/parent/landing\">submit the form online</a>.</li><li><strong>Sign the Master Promissory Note (MPN): </strong>Finally, before funds are disbursed, you must complete a Master Promissory Note. This explains the terms and conditions of your loan, and it can be submitted after successfully completing the Direct PLUS Loan application.</li></ol><h2>Alternatives to parent PLUS Loans</h2><p>PLUS Loans are just one choice for parents who want to help their children complete their education. Other options include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Private parent student loans: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-parent-student-loans\">Private parent loans</a> are available from online lenders, banks, and credit unions. You'll generally need to qualify based on your credit, but these loans are sometimes more affordable because there's often no origination fee, and the rates may be lower for well-qualified borrowers.</li><li><strong>Student loans in your child's name:</strong> Students can take out federal and private student loans on their own or with a parent cosigner. Unlike parent PLUS loans, they would be the primary or sole borrower responsible for repayment. Notably, students can access better loan terms and more perks with federal student loans than what’s available to their parents.</li><li><strong>Scholarships, grants, and work-study programs:</strong> All of these options allow students to cover some school costs with money they typically don't have to repay.</li><li><strong>College savings plans:</strong> Saving for college using special tools such as a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/529-plan\">529 account</a> can help parents and children keep borrowing costs down.</li></ul><p>It's a good idea to explore all of these options before deciding which is the best approach to fund a college degree.</p><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/parent-plus-vs-private-parent-loans\">Parent PLUS Loans vs. Private Parent Loans</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252862":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252862","content":"<p>If you've just bought a home, upsized to a bigger rental, or simply need to refresh your interior, a furniture loan can help you finance the expense.

That includes buy now, pay later (BNPL) agreements, store-branded and 0% APR promotional credit cards, furniture store loans offered by partner lenders, home equity loans, and other options that we'll cover later in this guide.</p><p>A personal loan for furniture is a type of installment loan that provides a lump sum of cash in exchange for equal monthly payments over several months or years. Rates on personal loans typically range from 6.49% APR to 35.99% APR.</p><p>Personal loan lenders typically require a credit check and proof of income. You can apply for a personal loan from an online lender, bank, or credit union and receive the money quickly, typically within a few business days.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252866":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252866","content":"<h2>How to compare personal loans for furniture</h2><p>As you research <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, pay attention to the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Make sure the lender offers the amount you need. Some lenders require you to borrow a minimum of $5,000, while a few others may cap loan amounts at $10,000. Determine the total cost of the furniture you plan to buy, including tax, and your budget for repayment before choosing a lender.</li><li><strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong> Some lenders have more stringent requirements than others. Know your credit score before applying with any lender and, if possible, make sure you meet that lender's minimum credit score requirement. For example, LendingClub requires a minimum 660 FICO score for personal loans through Credible. You can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">check your credit score for free</a> with Credible's credit-monitoring tool.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> If you're taking out a large loan or have a tight budget, you might want a lender that offers extended repayment terms. For example, LightStream offers home improvement loans with repayment terms of up to 20 years that you can use to buy furniture. A longer repayment term lowers your monthly payment and gives you more time to repay, but you'll also pay more in interest over time. Shorter repayment terms are less costly.</li><li><strong>APR range:</strong> Most lenders advertise a range of annual percentage rates (APR), which tells you the annual cost of the loan as a percentage of the loan amount, including the interest rate and any upfront fees. But just because a lender has a low starting APR, doesn't mean you'll qualify for it. Generally, you need very good to excellent credit to qualify for a lender's lowest advertised APR.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Many personal loans come with an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>, which is an upfront fee that often comes out of the loan funds. Most lenders also charge incidental fees, like late fees and returned check fees, though a few lenders like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/discover-personal-loans-review\">Discover</a> don't charge any fees.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Total cost: </strong>Personal loans with low APRs and short repayment terms generally cost the least, but it's important to ensure you can afford the monthly payment. Evaluate your budget and compare the total repayment cost of the loan options you're considering along with the monthly payment — you can also use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to compare loan costs and payments at different interest rates and repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Lender reputation: </strong>Evaluate the lender's reputation for customer service by reading customer reviews on third-party websites like Trustpilot, along with customer studies like <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study\">J.D. Power's 2025 Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study</a>.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252890":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252890","content":"<h2>Pros and cons of furniture personal loans</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252894":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252894","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Fixed repayment schedule: </strong>Since interest rates are fixed on personal loans, so are payments, unlike most credit cards and lines of credit.</li><li><strong>Lower APRs than credit cards, on average: </strong>A 2-year personal loan has an 11.57% APR on average, compared to 21.16% APR for the average credit card, according to the Federal Reserve.</li><li><strong>Quick funding: </strong>Unlike home equity financing, personal loans don't require a home appraisal or a lengthy underwriting process. Some lenders can issue the funds as soon as the same day you're approved.</li><li><strong>No collateral required: </strong>Most personal loans are unsecured, which means you don't need equity in your home or another valuable asset to offer as collateral.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>May be inaccessible if you have bad credit: </strong>Most personal loan borrowers have fair credit or better (a FICO score of at least 580). If you do get approved with bad credit, expect an APR above 30%.</li><li><strong>More expensive than short-term financing options:</strong> Some furniture financing options are interest-free, provided you can repay the full balance within one to two years. You might find these through an introductory APR on a new credit card, some BNPL plans, or store financing.</li><li><strong>Adds to your debt: </strong>Taking out a personal loan adds to your outstanding debt. This can affect your credit score, leave less wiggle room in your budget, and make it more difficult to save for the future.</li></ul><h2>How to get a personal loan for furniture</h2><p>Lenders may differ slightly, but most have a similar process for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">applying for a personal loan</a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong> Choose a few lenders that allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify</a> without damaging your credit. You can do this for free with multiple lenders at once through Credible. This process will provide you with an estimate of the APR and one or more repayment terms you might qualify for.</li><li><strong>Compare options: </strong>Compare prequalification quotes to choose the best loan option that meets your needs.</li><li><strong>Formally apply: </strong>Proceed with the formal application, answering additional questions and uploading required documents that prove your income and identity. Most lenders run a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a> at this stage, which may cause your credit score to dip temporarily.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Review and sign: </strong>If approved, read the terms and conditions carefully, checking the rate, fees, repayment term, and monthly payment. If everything looks good, e-sign your loan documents to initiate funding.</li><li><strong>Get your cash: </strong>The lender will transfer the funds to your bank account within a few days or as soon as the same day, in some cases.</li></ol><h3>How to get a personal loan for furniture with bad credit</h3><p>Getting a personal loan with bad credit can be a challenge, but there are a few strategies that might help:</p><ul><li><strong>Research </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><strong>bad credit lenders</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Some lenders have lower minimum credit score requirements than others. For example, Avant considers applicants with a credit score as low as 550 and OneMain Financial has no minimum credit score requirement.</li><li><strong>Look for secured personal loans: </strong>It may be easier to qualify for a personal loan if you offer collateral, or a valuable asset. Collateral reduces the lender's risk since the lender can take the asset if you fail to repay. For example, Oportun and OneMain Financial offer personal loans secured by the title to your car and may accept borrowers with bad credit.</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner or co-borrower:</strong> If you have a friend or family member with good credit, you could ask them to guarantee payment of the loan as a cosigner or co-applicant, which might help you qualify. A few <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">lenders allow cosigners</a>, and many allow co-borrowers — the difference is that a cosigner merely guarantees the loan, while a co-borrower has equal access to the funds.</li><li><strong>Improve your credit: </strong>If you can wait to buy furniture, make an effort to pay down debt and pay your monthly bills on time to improve your credit score. You could also try a credit improvement tool like <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/credit/score-boost/\">Experian Boost</a>.</li></ul><h2>Other financing options for new furniture</h2><p>Depending on your financial situation and the furniture you plan to buy, a personal loan might not be optimal for your needs. Consider the following alternatives.</p><h3>In-store financing and store-branded credit cards</h3><p>Some furniture stores offer financing options like installment loans or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/appliance-financing\">lease-to-own contracts</a>, typically through a third-party lender or leasing company. These options sometimes include unique features you won't find from a direct lender. For example, Bob's Discount Furniture offers a few options through its leasing and lending partners that don't require a credit score.</p><p>Many furniture retailers also offer deferred interest promotions when you apply for a store-branded credit card. This might be a good option if you plan to buy all your furniture from the same store and you're confident you can pay the balance in full within the promotional period. For example, the Wayfair credit card allows you to avoid interest for up to 24 months on purchases of $2,999 or more. But if you're unable to pay off the balance within that time frame, you'll be charged interest from the date of purchase at a high variable APR. Deferred financing promotions are common and typically have higher minimum purchase amounts for longer deferred interest periods.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252874":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252874","content":"<h3>0% APR credit card</h3><p>Some credit card issuers offer a 0% APR promotional period for new cardholders. Unlike store credit cards, issuers like Wells Fargo and Chase allow you to buy furniture at any retailer that accepts that card brand, and you can avoid interest for up to 21 months. These promotions are typically zero-interest promotions rather than deferred interest promotions. This means you won't be charged interest on the full amount if you don't pay it off within the promotional period. Instead, interest starts accruing at the end of the promotional period and only on the remaining amount you owe.</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies like Klarna and Affirm provide point-of-sale financing at many furniture retailers. You apply at checkout, the store fulfills your order, and you repay the BNPL provider. BNPL options have expanded: it used to be that you'd have to pay back the loan in four biweekly installments, including an upfront payment, to avoid interest. But you might qualify for a longer interest-free repayment term — like 12 months — depending on the provider and your credit.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252898","content":"<p>Most BNPL providers won't run a hard credit check to see if you're eligible for short-term financing, but may run one if you need a years-long repayment term. Also, they previously haven't reported payments (or non-payments) to the major credit bureaus. But credit reporting rules are changing soon for BNPL plans. “FICO intends to factor BNPL loans into credit scores starting this fall,” says Lana Wear, founder and CEO at HomeWear Designs. “This means that bad BNPL repayment behavior will negatively impact your credit score.”</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A home equity loan is secured by your home equity, or the share of your home that you own outright. Home equity loans require closing costs, can take weeks to close, and nonpayment can lead to foreclosure. But they could be a good option for very large furniture purchases, since they typically have lower APRs than personal loans.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252902":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252902","content":"<h3>HELOC</h3><p>A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is similar to a home equity loan — it uses your home as collateral. The difference is that you can draw against your credit line on an ongoing basis and only pay interest on the funds you use. A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/heloc?source=global-nav\">HELOC</a> can be helpful if you're furnishing your home little by little or you don't know how much you're going to spend.</p><h3>Personal line of credit</h3><p>Some banks and credit unions offer their customers a personal line of credit (PLOC), which is similar to a HELOC except that it's unsecured. A PLOC could have a higher APR than a personal loan, depending on your credit, but can be a good option if you plan to furnish your home in phases.</p><h3>Savings</h3><p>If your budget is tight, saving for your furniture purchase might be the best option. “If the purchase would strain your finances or you won't be able to pay a loan back per the terms of the agreement, wait,” says Wear. “It can actually be fun to build your space gradually — layers built over time give your home character and charm.” Some furniture stores also offer layaway programs that encourage you to deposit money in a dedicated savings account.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:310614":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"310614","content":"<p>Most large national banks, such as Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America, no longer issue student loans.

You'll also need to decide whether you'd prefer a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fixed-or-variable-rate\">fixed or variable rate</a>. A fixed rate will remain the same over the life of your loan, which means your payment won't ever change.

You can use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-refinance-calculator\">student loan repayment calculator</a> to see what your monthly payment will be under different repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Cosigner release: </strong>Some lenders allow <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigners</a> to be released from the loan once you've made on-time payments for a certain amount of time. If you'd like to remove your cosigner from the loan in the future, be sure to check whether the lender offers cosigner release.</li><li><strong>Discounts: </strong>Depending on the lender, you can take advantage of discounts.

Here's what to look at when comparing $45,000 personal loans.</p><h3>1. APR (annual percentage rate)</h3><p>The cost of borrowing is typically expressed as&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">APR</a>, which accounts for interest and any upfront lender fees. Personal loan APRs range between 6.49% and 35.99%, with the lowest interest rates reserved for <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\">borrowers with excellent credit</a>. A loan with a high APR will increase the total amount you pay for borrowing and may result in a higher monthly payment compared to a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-low-interest-loan\">low-interest loan</a>.</p><p>Personal loan APRs are typically fixed rather than variable, so the size of your monthly payment and total interest costs over the life of the loan would remain the same.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR vs. Interest Rate on a Personal Loan: What To Know</a></p><h3>2. Fees</h3><p>Many lenders <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">charge&nbsp;origination fees</a> to cover the cost of underwriting and processing personal loans, often deducted upfront from the loan amount. This fee is typically a percentage, which could be between 0% and 12% of your loan, depending on the lender and your credit profile. But it may also be a flat fee.</p><p>A few lenders, generally banks, don't charge any fees for their personal loans, including late fees. But most charge a fee if you don't make your monthly payment on time. Late fees can be a percentage of your missed payment — sometimes as much as 15% of the payment amount — or a flat fee, sometimes between $5 and $30 per payment.&nbsp;</p><p>A prepayment penalty is a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">fee for paying your loan off early</a>. Very few lenders charge a prepayment penalty for personal loans nowadays.</p><p>Lenders must include the details of any fees charged in the loan agreement as required by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finred.usalearning.gov/assets/downloads/FINRED-TruthLendingAct-FS.pdf\">Truth in Lending Act</a> (TILA).&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Repayment terms</h3><p>Personal loans typically have <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> between two and seven years, although terms vary by lender. Some lenders, like <a href=\"/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream </a>and <a href=\"/personal-loan/bhg-personal-loans-review\">BHG Financial</a>, offer repayment terms longer than 10 years. But you may need to use the loan for a purpose that qualifies for a long repayment term, like home improvement or debt consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, choosing a longer repayment term can lower your monthly loan payment. The flip side of that is that you'll likely pay more interest over your loan's term by extending the repayment period. Plus, rates tend to be higher on longer-term loans.</p><p>Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to see how the length of repayment terms can affect monthly payments and interest costs.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:11130":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"11130","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"blog-calculator","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:249222":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"249222","content":"<h3>4. Monthly payment</h3><p>Your monthly payment includes the amount you borrow plus interest, divided into <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">equal payments</a> throughout your loan term. Monthly payments can vary significantly between $45K loans, depending on your APR and repayment term. <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalifying with lenders</a> can help you compare loan quotes and their payments.</p><p>Once you find a loan you think you can afford, test that payment in <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">your budget</a>, suggests Andrew Lokenauth, founder of TheFinanceNewsletter.com and a finance professional who has held multiple Wall Street banking positions.</p><p>“Take your desired monthly payment and add 25% to it,” says Lokenauth. “The extra buffer accounts for unexpected expenses that always seem to pop up.” For example, say a prequalification quote gives you an estimated loan payment of $1,500. Add 25% to that, for a total of $1,875. “Set that amount aside for three months before taking the loan,” explains Lokenauth, who says that doing so can keep you from overextending yourself financially.</p><h3>5. Total repayment costs</h3><p>Comparing your total repayment costs can give you a clearer picture of which loan is most affordable in the long term.</p><p>Here's why: Once you pay off your loan, you'll have paid for the entire original loan balance, plus fees and interest. Your total repayment costs are higher than the $45,000 you borrowed, and could be significantly higher if you had a long loan term or a high APR.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a seven-year $45,000 loan with a 26% APR results in $53,108 in interest — more than the original loan amount. To compare, you'd pay $9,584 in interest for a three-year loan with a 13% APR.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the cost to repay a $45,000 loan?</h2><p>Your monthly payments and total interest paid make up the total cost to repay a $45,000 loan. Higher APRs and longer repayment terms can raise total costs.&nbsp;</p><p>To show how different loans can compare, we've detailed some examples of three-, five-, and seven-year $45,000 loans with various APRs below.

Check the tables above as a guide, or use a&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to calculate potential monthly payments and total costs.</li><li><strong>Shop around for a lender:</strong> Look for lenders that welcome borrowers with similar credit profiles. Also, make sure the lenders you consider offer $45,000 loans, as some max out at $40K or lower. The size of personal loans typically ranges from $1,000 to $100,000, with a few lenders offering loans of up to $250,000.</li><li><strong>Prequalify with multiple lenders:</strong> Many lenders let you fill out a quick form to prequalify for a loan. Prequalification lets you see the APR and repayment term you may qualify for if you apply, although it's not an offer of credit.

These options are based on the equity you've built up and are secured by your property, so you may qualify for a lower interest rate than you'd get with an <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\">unsecured personal loan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these loans come with some trade-offs. Generally, home equity options take longer to approve — in some cases, several weeks — and you could face foreclosure if you fall behind on payments. Plus, you may need to pay for expenses such as <a href=\"/mortgage/what-are-closing-costs\">closing costs</a> and <a href=\"/mortgage/what-is-a-home-appraisal\">appraisals</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, most lenders limit how much you can borrow, typically up to 80% of your home's value minus what you owe on your mortgage. So if your home is worth $250,000 and you owe $150,000, you could qualify for a loan of up to $50,000.&nbsp;</p><h3>401(k) loan</h3><p>Some plan administrators allow <a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\">loans from 401(k) plans</a>. You may be able to borrow up to 50% of your vested account balance up to $50,000 (or up to $10,000 if 50% of your balance is less than $10,000).&nbsp;</p><p>If you take out a 401(k) loan, you're borrowing against your retirement savings, and the money you borrow won't be eligible for gains.

Scholarships and grants may also be at risk.</p><p>“Students who leave at the end of a semester or academic year can just decline grants or scholarships for the upcoming semester,” Bishop says. “But the rules get wonky if you leave in the middle of a semester.”</p><p>If you leave mid-semester, you may be required to repay grant and scholarship funds that were tied to your academic performance, such as maintaining a certain GPA. But there are ways to avoid this.</p><p>“Try to stay until the end of the semester or negotiate for incompletes for the term, which gives you several weeks into the next semester to complete the coursework,” advises Bishop.</p><h2>How to take a break from college</h2><p>Taking a leave of absence requires certain paperwork, even in an emergency. You'll need to understand your school's leave of absence policy and notify your school of the upcoming break.</p><p>“There's a lot of timeliness for certain types of notification,” says Bishop. “If you have to leave suddenly, you may miss a deadline, which could affect your ability to get future financial aid.”</p><p>If you're considering a leave of absence, Bishop recommends taking the following steps to prepare:</p><ol><li><strong>Meet with your academic adviser: </strong>Your adviser can walk you through your school's leave of absence policies and help you complete any required paperwork.</li><li><strong>Check with the Office of Student Affairs: </strong>This may also be called the Office of Student Services.

Compare multiple lenders to find the best refinance rates</h2><p>Every lender has a different way of setting interest rates, so it pays to shop around. According to a <a href=\"https://www.freddiemac.com/fmac-resources/research/pdf/201804-Insight.pdf\">Freddie Mac</a> survey, borrowers save an average of $6,000 over the life of their mortgage by getting five rate quotes.</p><p>When looking at offers, be sure to compare both the interest rate and the annual percentage rate with each lender. The APR is a better indicator of the total cost of the loan because it includes the interest rate along with any fees the lender charges.</p><h2>7. Set a limit on your loan amount</h2><p>With some refinance loans, such as cash-out refinances, you take out a loan amount that’s higher than your current mortgage balance and pocket the difference. But this generally leads to a higher interest rate because you’re increasing your loan-to-value ratio (LTV).</p><p>An LTV ratio measures how much equity you have in your home compared to your mortgage balance.</p><p>To calculate your LTV ratio, divide the mortgage balance by the home’s market value, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:246462":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"246462","content":"<h2>8.

A fixed rate won’t change throughout the life of the loan. An ARM, on the other hand, starts with a fixed interest rate for a set period, typically three, five, seven, or 10 years.

This fee is accounted for in the APR, but it typically reduces the amount of money you receive since it's subtracted upfront from the loan funds. The higher the fee, the more you'll have to borrow to end up with the amount you need. Also, look for late payment and other lender fees.</li><li><strong>Look for discounts:</strong> Some lenders offer rate discounts for autopay or if you direct the lender to pay off your creditors directly (if you're using the loan to consolidate credit card debt or other debt).</li><li><strong>Compare repayment terms:</strong> Choose a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment term</a> that balances manageable monthly payments with the overall interest cost. Longer loan terms typically have lower monthly payments but cost more overall in interest. The opposite is true of shorter loan terms.</li><li><strong>Consider other borrower requirements:</strong> In addition to requiring a minimum credit score, lenders often have a minimum income requirement and a maximum <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income</a> requirement.

If not, your application could be denied — which could be a problem if the lender conducted a hard credit check when you applied (and most do). That's because hard credit checks can drag your score down by a few points, which isn't great when you already have fair credit. A score that's a few points lower could mean the difference between getting a loan and not.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid this and get a loan as easily and quickly as possible, take the following steps.&nbsp;</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li><strong>Check your credit score:</strong> Know where you stand before applying. This will help you eliminate lenders who require a higher credit score than yours.

You can also see whether you're likely to be charged an origination fee, how much each lender might approve you for, and available repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Gather documents:</strong> When you apply for a personal loan, you may need to provide proof of income, identity, and employment with paystubs or tax returns and a government ID.</li><li><strong>Consider a cosigner or applying with a co-applicant:</strong> Either could help you get approved for a loan or lower your rate. The lender considers both your financial criteria and theirs when making a lending decision. Note that a cosigner doesn't share in the loan proceeds, while a co-applicant does. Few lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loans with cosigners</a>, but many more offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\">joint personal loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Consider a secured loan:</strong> You might improve your chances of qualifying for a loan or getting a lower interest rate if you offer collateral.

At this point, lenders typically conduct a hard credit check, which could ding your credit score by up to 10 points for up to 1 year.</li><li><strong>Review the loan agreement:</strong> If approved for a loan, the lender will send a loan agreement with specific rates, fees, the repayment schedule, and other terms. This could differ from the prequalification quote you received, so examine it closely to make sure the terms work for you.

Here's how:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce credit card balances:</strong> By reducing your credit utilization (the percentage of available credit you use), you can make meaningful improvements to your credit score within one month. One way is to pay off new charges every month. Another is to use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation loan</a> to pay off your credit cards. It might seem counterintuitive to get one loan to improve your chances of getting another, but if you carry high balances (especially if you can get an equal or lower interest rate with a debt consolidation loan), it could be worthwhile</li><li><strong>Increase your credit limit:</strong> This tip is along the same lines as the previous one. If your existing creditors are willing to increase your credit limits, you can reduce your credit utilization — which can quickly boost your score. Another way to do this is to become an authorized user on a family member's or good friend's credit card. Just be sure they maintain a low or no balance and have good credit (otherwise, this tactic can backfire).</li><li><strong>Pay bills on time:</strong> This is an essential practice for getting and maintaining good credit. Start now, since it can take a positive payment history of several months to see results.</li><li><strong>Avoid new hard credit inquiries:</strong> Don't apply for credit just to see if you can get approved. That costs you points off your credit score. Whenever you apply for a loan, do so with the intention of getting the loan to improve your situation.</li><li><strong>Check your credit report:</strong> Scour your report for errors and dispute any with the appropriate bureau. To view your free credit report from each bureau, visit <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Secured credit card:</strong> A secured credit card can help you build credit while giving you a small line of credit based on an initial deposit amount. Payments are reported to the credit bureaus, so timely payments can help improve your score.</li><li><strong>Credit-builder loan:</strong> If you need a relatively small loan and can wait for the money, <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">consider a credit-builder loan</a>. With this type of loan, you make a series of payments, usually from six months to two years, and then receive the full amount once you've finished paying the loan.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list.

The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month.

However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

No-interest loans exist in various forms, such as “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) apps and cash advance apps. However, “no-interest” or “zero-interest” doesn't necessarily mean zero cost.</p><p>These loans may come with strings attached, and in some cases, could cost more than a loan that charges standard interest. Here's a closer look at 0% interest loans and what you need to know.</p><h2>Is it possible to get an interest-free loan?</h2><p>Yes, it's possible to get interest-free loans, but most are for short-term financing needs and need to be repaid within two weeks to a few months. Loan amounts are typically limited as well. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\"><strong>Buy now, pay later</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some retailers and financial services companies offer BNPL options. As long as you make payments as agreed — often in four biweekly payments — you can avoid paying interest. However, BNPL loans may charge fees for late or missed payments.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Apps like Earnin and Klover use your next paycheck as collateral to lend small amounts of cash. These apps typically don't charge interest but may have fees, such as a monthly membership or instant transfer fees. More importantly, because of short repayment periods and fees, the cost of using a cash advance app could be the equivalent of paying more than 300% APR.</li><li><strong>Payroll advance financing:</strong> You might be able to get a paycheck advance or earned wage access through your employer. These advances may not be 100% interest-free, but if interest is charged, it's typically much lower than other short-term options such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Payment plans from healthcare providers or organizations:</strong> Healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and physicians' offices, might be willing to create an interest-free payment plan for you to encourage payment. Healthcare payment financing services offer loans or lines of credit with no or low interest, although some might charge deferred interest.</li><li><strong>Educational scholarships and emergency student loan programs:</strong> Some schools offer interest-free emergency student loans or interest-free scholarships through financial aid offices and scholarship programs. However, loan amounts may be small, and a co-signer may be required.</li><li><strong>Carmaker auto financing:</strong> Occasionally, some car manufacturers may offer interest-free 0% financing on new cars. Only those with very good or excellent credit are likely to get approved for 0% APR financing.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\"><strong>0% APR credit cards</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some credit card issuers offer introductory 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers, with introductory periods lasting up to 21 months before the regular APR applies. Remember that you'll need to pay for the purchase or balance transfer in full before the introductory offer ends to avoid interest.</li></ul><p>Some credit cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, that is added to the card's balance. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% balance transfer fee would cost $150.</p><p>If you're a student, ask your school about emergency student loans. For example, the Marshall University Emergency Loan Program provides one loan of up to $250 per semester if you have a financial emergency.</p><p>Moreover, nonprofits like the Jewish Free Loan Association offer emergency, business, education, and wellness loans with 0% interest or fees to all types of borrowers.

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees. Terms typically range from a couple of weeks to 21 months, but high-ticket items, like cars, may have terms of 48 months or more.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, say you purchased a new car for $30,000 with a $5,000 down payment and 0% financing for 48 months. Paying off the remaining $25,000 balance would mean making 48 monthly payments of $521. Although you can avoid interest with a 0% APR financing if you repay on time, missed payments could lead to cancellation of the zero-interest offer. You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.</p><p>Another example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone. With the typical BNPL loan, you’d pay $250 upfront and agree to make three more biweekly payments of $250. You’ll likely be charged a late fee if you&nbsp;miss a payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Both these examples might truly be no-cost loans. But some no-interest loans are high-cost. For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5. Since the loan is due in two weeks, the cost is equivalent to an 87% APR. If you add a $2 tip to the $5 instant transfer fee, the cost is equivalent to a 122% APR.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:236974":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"236974","content":"<h2>Why are zero-interest loans risky?</h2><p>There are three main features that make many no-interest loans a risky proposition: short repayment times, deferred interest, and ease of approval. Here’s more on each.&nbsp;</p><h3>Short repayment periods</h3><p>No-interest loans can be challenging to repay because some have short payback periods. Longer-term loans, like personal loans, often have <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">years-long repayment periods</a>, which can mean much lower payments.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, if you take out a $500 cash advance via a cash app to cover an emergency expense, the entire $500 would be due with your next paycheck.

Mathews explains that it's a good idea to look for scholarships earlier rather than later: “Senior year in high school is the most common time for our students to receive scholarships,” he says.

Private lenders may offer both fixed and variable rates. Variable rates can start lower but may increase over time depending on market conditions.</li><li><strong>Loan fees: </strong>Federal loans charge a percentage of the amount you borrow as a loan origination fee. This is deducted from your loan before the money is sent to your school, so you'll receive less than the amount you borrow. Most private lenders don't charge origination fees.</li><li><strong>Your credit score: </strong>If you have excellent credit, you may qualify for a lower rate on a private student loan compared with a federal grad PLUS loan. Check your credit before applying to see where you stand.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms: </strong>Federal loans offer more repayment flexibility, including income-driven repayment plans that adjust your payments to a percentage of your income. Terms typically range from 10 to 25 years. Private student loans usually offer terms between 5 and 20 years, but don't offer the same flexibility.</li><li><strong>Forgiveness potential: </strong>Federal loans offer benefits that can reduce or even eliminate <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/statistics/average-law-school-debt\">law school debt</a> over time. For example, if you decide to work in government or a qualifying nonprofit role, you may be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Private lenders may offer some hardship options, but they do not offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">forgiveness options</a>.</li><li><strong>Customer reviews: </strong>While federal loans all come from the same source, private loans are available through different private lenders. It can be a good idea to look up customer reviews for private lenders on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau (BBB).</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:232870":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"232870","content":"<h2>Borrowing tips for law school students</h2><p>Figuring out how to pay for law school is one piece of the puzzle.

You can use search engines like <a href=\"https://www.fastweb.com/\">Fastweb</a> or <a href=\"https://www.scholarships.com/\">Scholarships.com</a> to find private scholarships for law students, and check with your school's financial aid office about institutional scholarships or grants.</li><li><strong>Maximize federal loans: </strong>Federal student loans offer benefits you won't get with private lenders, IDR plans, and forgiveness through programs like PSLF. These can be especially valuable if you plan to work in the public sector or for a nonprofit.</li><li><strong>Consider your earning potential: </strong>Before taking out a large sum of money, understand your future earning potential. Lawyers' salaries can vary widely, whether you're working at a Big Law firm, a public interest organization, or the government. The median pay for lawyers was $145,760 per year as of 2023, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a>.</li><li><strong>Borrow only what you need: </strong>You might be offered more student loans than you actually need.

Reduce current debt</h2><p>In addition to putting more money toward debt repayment, there are ways to reduce<i> </i>the amount you need to repay in the first place. Here are some ideas to get you thinking:</p><ul><li><strong>Negotiate:</strong> Try to <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/negotiate-credit-card-debt\">negotiate your debt</a>. It’s not always successful, but you’ll never know if you don’t ask, and persistence can help. Call your credit card companies and lenders to ask if they can offer lower monthly payments or better interest rates.</li><li><strong>Use a debt management plan (DMP):</strong> With the help of a credit counseling organization, you might consider a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a> to consolidate debts and secure lower interest rates. Though a DMP won’t have a direct impact on your credit, it could hurt it indirectly. For example, if the credit counselor requires that you close old accounts, it could hurt your score by negatively impacting your credit history and credit utilization.</li><li><strong>Replace expensive assets:</strong> If you’re making payments on expensive assets like a car or house, reduce your debt burden by downsizing. For example, you could replace a new car with a used one with a smaller payment, or move from a larger home to a smaller one.</li><li><strong>Use bankruptcy as a last resort:</strong> When you run out of options, <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-bankruptcy\">bankruptcy is a way to clear up your debt</a> by either liquidating nonexempt assets and writing off eligible debts or getting set up with a payment plan. Note that in bankruptcy, you generally get to keep necessary assets like your home or car (as long as they’re not above a certain price point), but it’ll have a major negative impact on your credit score. Talk to a bankruptcy attorney to better understand your options and the costs to file (both monetary and credit-wise) before proceeding.</li><li><strong>Refinance:</strong> You can refinance all sorts of debt, including car loans, <a href=\"/mortgage/how-to-refinance-your-mortgage\">mortgages</a>, and personal loans. Refinancing allows you to replace the current loan with a new one at a lower interest rate. If your credit has improved or rates have dropped since you got the original loan, refinancing can be a quick and easy win.</li></ul><h2>5. Liquidate assets</h2><p>Selling unused or unwanted items is a simple way to raise cash quickly. And if you’re in a hurry to pay off your debt, a little extra money can go a long way.</p><p>You can make significant money by either selling a few high-value items or a lot of lower-value items. When it comes to high-value items, think jewelry, electronics, and designer clothing. If you don’t have any high-value items you want to sell, you can still make money selling clothes and household items via an old-fashioned garage sale or more modern equivalents, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1889067784738765\">Facebook Marketplace</a>, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\">Poshmark</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites\">Craigslist</a>.</p><h2>6. Cancel or downgrade subscriptions</h2><p>Many people have a subscription they don’t know about, forgot about, or no longer need. For example, maybe you jumped on a free trial for a streaming service to binge that one<i> </i>show — and now, months later, you’re still paying for it. Rather than letting that money slip away month after month, reclaim that cash and funnel it toward debt payoff.</p><p>Pull up your bank statements and scan them for forgotten or overlooked subscriptions. Cancel any you don’t want and reroute that money toward your debt. If you don’t have any subscriptions you want to get rid of, consider downgrading to save a little money.</p><h2>7. Cut spending</h2><p>While reviewing your bank statements for unwanted subscriptions, analyze your spending as a whole. Chances are, there are some spending categories you can cut to pay off your debt faster.</p><p>Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Eliminate food delivery services and pick up takeout yourself.</li><li>Cook dinner at home more often.</li><li>Put a 1- to 3-month pause on new clothes spending and shop secondhand.</li><li>Brew coffee at home or more often (if you buy a $5 cup of coffee three times a week, that’s almost an extra $50 you could save per month, not to mention tips).</li><li>Have your friends over instead of going out.</li></ul><p>While making these lifestyle changes can help you pay off your debt faster, don’t be tempted to cut everything enjoyable out of your life.

Shop insurance quotes</h2><p>While cutting discretionary expenses is great, don’t forget to audit your bills, too. One major expense to keep an eye on is insurance. If you choose a policy without comparing different insurers, chances are you’re leaving money on the table. Or, if your credit has since improved since taking the policy out, you could be eligible for much better rates.</p><p>Different insurance carriers have different criteria for how they price their coverage. You may qualify for one rate with Carrier A, but a lower rate with Carrier B. Shop insurance policies regularly to make sure you’re getting the best rates possible.

Strategically pay down debt</h2><p>Paying down debt without a strategy might work eventually, but it’s not the fastest way to become debt-free. Using a strategy like the debt snowball method or the debt avalanche method can help speed up your debt payoff while keeping you motivated.</p><ul><li><strong>Debt snowball:</strong> The debt snowball method involves paying off your debts according to their balances — from smallest to largest — while making minimum payments on the rest. This method works best for those who need extra motivation and may benefit from a win early on.</li><li><strong>Debt avalanche:</strong> The debt avalanche method involves paying off your debt according to interest rates — from highest to lowest. Of course, you still make minimum payments on each balance every month. This method is more efficient than the debt snowball method, but it may take you longer to pay off that first balance.</li></ul><p>Choose a strategy that works for you, and stick with it.

Earn more money</h2><p>Cutting costs and negotiating your debts are two great ways to pay off your debt faster, but don’t overlook your ability to earn more money. There could be countless ways to earn more each month, depending on your situation, and even a small boost in your income can expedite the debt payoff process.</p><p>Here are a few ways to bring in a little extra cash:</p><ul><li><strong>Start a side business:</strong> With a little extra time, you can sell a product or service outside of your full-time job. For example, you could walk dogs, sell handmade jewelry, or be a virtual assistant.</li><li><strong>Work a gig job:</strong> You don’t have to start a business to make extra cash. There are plenty of companies — like <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/\">Uber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shipt.com/shopper/be-a-shopper\">Shipt</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.rover.com/become-a-sitter/\">Rover</a> — that let you work whenever you want.</li><li><strong>Get a roommate:</strong> Have an extra room in your house or apartment?

But it’s still worth reviewing your loan terms to make sure there is no penalty that could cut into any interest savings from paying early.</li></ul><h2>Simple strategies for paying off loans</h2><p>Here are some strategies to consider for paying off debt. Just note that reducing the amount you owe on your credit cards could have a more positive impact on your credit score (and budget) than paying off an installment loan early.</p><h3>Budgeting</h3><p>Making a budget can help you allocate more of your income toward debt repayment, so you can make progress faster and minimize the amount you pay in interest. It can also help you save money and break free from a cycle of debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Having <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">money set aside for emergencies</a> makes it less likely you’ll need to turn to credit cards and other types of debt to pay for unexpected expenses. There are many popular budgeting apps and tools available, but if you prefer a more traditional paper budget or spreadsheet, these are also an option.</p><h3>Debt snowball or avalanche method</h3><p>Two of the best strategies for paying off debt are the debt snowball and avalanche methods. The debt snowball method involves prioritizing paying off your smallest debt first, while making all other minimum payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the smallest balance has been paid off, add the amount you were putting toward it to the minimum payment on the next-smallest balance, and so on. By prioritizing the smaller balances first, you’ll likely see progress faster, which can help boost motivation.</p><p>The debt avalanche method works similarly, but involves first focusing your attention on the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the avalanche method can help reduce the total amount of interest you pay on your debts, but it may take longer to see initial results.</p><h3>Loan refinancing</h3><p>Sometimes, you may want to replace a high-interest loan with a lower-interest one, instead of paying it off entirely. This is common, for example, with mortgages and personal loans.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, you'd <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply for a new loan</a> and use it to pay off the old one, thereby reducing your interest rate and monthly payments.

Request copies from the three credit bureaus or <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> to gauge where you stand.

You’ll typically need a FICO score of at least 670 to get a personal loan, but a higher score may help you land better terms.

You can calculate your DTI by adding up your monthly debt payments and dividing them by your gross monthly income.</li><li><strong>Payment history:</strong> Lenders want to make sure that you can and will repay the loan, so if you have a history that includes late payments, that will be a strike against you. Keep in mind that late payments usually stay on your credit report for seven years, but they tend to have less impact on your score the older they are.</li><li><strong>Income requirements: </strong>You’ll have to meet the lender’s minimum income requirement to have your application considered.

If you default on the loan, the lender could seize the collateral to recoup its money. In exchange, a secured loan can have higher loan amounts and lower interest rates.</p><p>“Putting collateral up for a loan means that missed payments can result in loss of that property,” says Ashley F. Morgan, a debt and bankruptcy lawyer at Ashley F. Morgan Law.</p><p>She recommends asking yourself: If you lost your job, would you be able to make payments on a secured debt till you found new employment? Would you be able to work part-time and get by until you find full-time work? If not, consider if you'd be okay with losing that asset in a worst-case scenario.</p><h2>Unsecured debt consolidation loan</h2><p>An unsecured debt consolidation loan doesn't require you to pledge any collateral. As a result, it can be harder to qualify for than a secured loan. Additionally, the lack of collateral tends to lead to lower loan amounts and higher interest rates.</p><p>“If a person is afraid of losing collateral, they might be more at ease with an unsecured option despite the higher costs,” says Reilly Renwick, chief marketing officer at Pragmatic Mortgage. “Borrowers need to gauge their financial steadiness, availability of assets, and comfort with risk.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:8426":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"8426","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"embedded-prequal","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227530":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227530","content":"<h2>Secured debt consolidation loan options</h2><p>While secured debt consolidation loans come in different forms, two of the most common are secured personal loans and home equity loans.</p><h3>Secured personal loan</h3><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loan</a> provides a lump sum upfront for personal purposes, including debt consolidation. The loan amount is secured by collateral, such as a car, the funds in a savings or CD (certificate of deposit), or even the fixtures in your home. You may have anywhere from a few years to seven years to repay the loan; interest rates and payments are typically fixed.</p><p>Secured personal loans may take longer to approve and fund than unsecured loans since lenders typically need to evaluate or appraise the collateral. That said, they may not take as long to fund as a home equity loan.</p><h3>Home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by the equity you've built in your home — your home's current market value minus the outstanding balance on your mortgage. Upon approval, you can take out a loan or line of credit and use it to pay off your debt balances.</p><p>If you opt for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a>, you'll receive a lump sum and repay the loan amount through fixed payments over a set term, up to 30 years. On the other hand, a home equity line of credit (<a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">HELOC</a>) grants you access to a revolving credit line for a set number of years, known as a draw period.

Here are the key factors to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit:</strong> Your credit plays a major role in both loan types, but poor to fair credit can be more of an obstacle when seeking unsecured loans. If you're <a href=\"/personal-loan/denied-personal-loan\">struggling to get approved for an unsecured loan</a> with an interest rate that can save you money, you may have better luck going the secured route because the collateral reduces the risk for the lender.</li><li><strong>Assets:</strong> With a secured loan, the lender puts a legal claim called a lien against the asset you're using as collateral. Consider if you have an asset that will qualify and if you're comfortable pledging it.</li><li><strong>Loan amount:</strong> The <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">amount you can borrow</a> with an unsecured loan is based primarily on your credit and income, while unsecured loans also consider the value of your collateral. If you're finding you can't borrow enough money with an unsecured loan, a secured loan may help you qualify for a larger loan amount.</li><li><strong>Borrowing costs:</strong> Secured loans tend to come with lower interest rates than unsecured loans, which may help you save on borrowing costs. However, a home equity loan may include costs such as an appraisal and document fee. Consider both the cost of fees and potential interest savings when evaluating which option is cheapest.</li><li><strong>Application process:</strong> If you want a loan fast, the application process for an unsecured loan will likely be faster because it won't involve the vetting of an asset.</li></ul><p>You'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of your situation to decide which is best. A good place to start is collecting quotes to see the rates and terms that might be available to you. Remember, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalification</a> provides only an estimate and isn't an offer of credit. A loan offer itself may have different interest rates and terms.</p><p>“Beyond rates, the decision between a secured and unsecured debt consolidation loan often comes down to two key considerations: the borrower's financial situation and their risk tolerance,” says Josh Richner, founder at FaithWorks Financial.</p><p>He says that if someone is in a strong financial position and seeking to optimize their debts by consolidating at a lower rate, a secured loan could make sense. However, for borrowers experiencing financial hardship, securing a loan with a major asset like a home can add to the pressure of the debt.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227546":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227546","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\"><i>Best Debt Consolidation Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-loans-for-fair-credit\"><i>Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Fair Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-bad-credit\"><i>How To Get a Debt Consolidation Loan With Bad Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-to-consolidate-bills\"><i>How To Consolidate Bills Into One Payment</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-to-get-a-debt-consolidation-loan\"><i>How To Get a Debt Consolidation Loan</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-debt-consolidation-helps-credit\"><i>How Debt Consolidation Helps Your Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pros-and-cons-of-debt-consolidation\"><i>Pros and Cons of Debt Consolidation</i></a></li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227062":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227062","content":"<p>Personal loans can either help or hurt your credit, depending on a variety of factors.

Since your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, those on-time payments can help raise your credit score steadily over time. Additionally, it can show lenders that you're a responsible borrower and could make it easier for you to get credit in the future.</p><p>Set up automatic payments to avoid missing due dates. Some banks and online lenders also offer small APR discounts for setting up automatic payments.</p><h3>Credit utilization</h3><p>Your credit utilization ratio shows how much of your available credit you're using on revolving debt, such as credit cards. The ratio factors into your amounts owed, which makes up 30% of your credit score. While debt from personal loans doesn't factor into credit utilization, using a personal loan for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation</a> can have an indirect effect. The utilization ratio on any cards you pay off completely would drop to 0%, likely providing a boost to your credit score.</p><p>Credit utilization is measured both on individual accounts, such as each credit card, and as an aggregate of all your revolving debt. FICO recommends keeping your total credit utilization ratio below 10%.</p><h3>Credit mix</h3><p>Lenders generally like to see that you know how to handle several types of credit and loan accounts. As such, 10% of your credit score is based on your credit mix. If you don't have an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a>, such as a personal loan or auto loan, in your credit history, adding one might provide a slight boost to your credit score. Making timely monthly payments on the loan could help even more.</p><h2>How a personal loan can hurt your credit score</h2><ul><li><strong>Increases your debt:</strong> Taking on debt can bring down your score since, again, it would increase your total amount owed. This can affect your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</a>, which lenders also use to determine whether to lend to you. Your DTI is the amount you pay monthly toward your debt, divided by your pretax monthly income. In general, it's best to have a DTI below 35%.</li><li><strong>Adds a new credit inquiry:</strong> When you send in an application for a personal loan, it triggers a hard credit inquiry, which is added to your credit profile. While this will typically have only a <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">small impact on your credit</a>, the number of inquiries over the last 12 months is also counted. In general, you want this number to be as small as possible. Inquiries typically stay on your credit report for two years.</li></ul><p>“It's also critical to know you'll be able to make payments before taking out a personal loan. Your score can easily deteriorate if you find you can't make those payments on time or you begin to lag behind,” said Christian Simmons, a certified educator in personal finance. “A credit score can seem like an abstract or unimportant concept to some people, but having a good one can put you ahead in a number of financial situations — while having a poor one can significantly set you back.”</p><h2>What credit score is needed for a personal loan?</h2><p>Lenders generally want to see that you can meet certain requirements, such as a certain <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score</a>, to approve your application.</p><p>Lenders typically want to see a “good” FICO score of 670 or higher, though minimums among lenders vary.</p><p>Here's how FICO breaks down credit score ranges:</p><ul><li><strong>Under 580:</strong> Poor</li><li><strong>580 to 669:</strong> Fair</li><li><strong>670 to 739:</strong> Good</li><li><strong>740 to 799:</strong> Very Good</li><li><strong>800 or higher:</strong> Exceptional</li></ul><h2>How to get a personal loan</h2><p>Here are the steps to take out a personal loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Determine your loan needs:</strong> You'll first need to know exactly <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">how much you need to borrow</a> and how you plan to use it. You should also know the features you require from a lender, such as online payments and discount opportunities.</li><li><strong>Gather documentation:</strong> Typically, you'll need to provide documentation such as pay stubs or bank statements, as well as proof of residence (like a utility bill) and a form of ID. Having those ready will streamline the application process.</li><li><strong>Shop around:</strong> You can start <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">comparing lenders</a> that meet your criteria. Consider factors such as loan amounts, time to fund, and repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Get prequalified:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> checks to see if you're likely to qualify with a given lender, and if so, what your terms might look like — without hurting your credit. You should keep in mind, however, that prequalification does not show the exact rates or terms you'd receive if you formally applied for the loan. So there's some room for error, though it's still a helpful tool.</li><li><strong>Pick a lender:</strong> Consider the potential costs associated with each lender, such as the <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which includes the interest rate and fees. But you should also check if the lender provides any of those extra features you pinpointed in your wish list. A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">loan calculator</a> can come in handy here, since it can compare the potential costs associated with each lender.</li><li><strong>Send in your application:</strong> Follow the instructions supplied by the lender, including supplying any additional materials it may request. At this point, the lender will conduct a hard credit inquiry, which can lower your score slightly for about a year. The amount of time it will take to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete the application</a> and get approved depends on the lender. Some lenders can <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">fund your loan</a> as soon as the same or next business day.</li><li><strong>Sign for the loan:</strong> Once approved, you can sign your loan documents, get your funds, and start making payments.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How To Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>How to improve your credit score after getting a personal loan</h2><p>Once you've received your loan, your work as a responsible credit user isn't done. Here are a few strategies that could help boost your credit score:</p><ul><li><strong>Repay your loan on time:</strong> Though a single on-time payment likely won't improve your credit score, making consistent on-time payments could make a big difference. Remember, payment history is the single largest factor in your FICO score, accounting for 35%.</li><li><strong>Consolidate debt, but don't eliminate cards: </strong>If you're using a debt consolidation loan to pay off credit cards, keep the cards open. The length of your credit history, which includes how long individual accounts have been open, accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Even though you may have resolved never to run up balances on those cards again, closing them would reduce the average age of your credit accounts.</li><li><strong>Wait before applying for new credit:</strong> Credit applications typically involve a hard credit inquiry that could lower your credit score by up to five points for as long as one year — and stay on your credit report for two years. So if the loan you just received triggered a hard credit check, your credit score may already be feeling the effects. Even a small, temporary dip in your credit score can chip away at any improvements you make.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye on your credit: </strong>Keeping tabs on your credit score can help you catch errors or unauthorized accounts that pop up. You can check your credit report for free with <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> or find out if your bank provides free credit monitoring.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227070":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227070","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\"><i>What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\"><i>What Are Personal Loans Used For?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\"><i>Secured vs. Unsecured Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan\"><i>Best Personal Loans</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Fair Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-good-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Good Credit</i></a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\"><i>Best Personal Loans for Excellent Credit</i></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:226242":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"226242","content":"<p>Paying a personal loan off early could mean less money spent on interest.

Consider this example:</p><p>According to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Credible loan rates data</a>, the average interest rate on a 5-year loan for someone with a 700 FICO score was around 24% in October 2023. For a <a href=\"/personal-loan/10k-loan\">$10,000 loan</a>, based on that rate, you’d pay $7,261 in interest over the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">loan’s term</a>. However, if instead of paying for the whole five years, you paid the loan off after two, you’d save $3,024.</p><p>If you paid it off after three years, or two years early, you’d save $1,463.</p><p>The higher the rate is on your loan, the more you can save by paying it off early.</p><h2>Prepayment penalty on a personal loan</h2><p>A prepayment penalty is a fee a financial institution may impose if you pay off your personal loan early. The bank’s rationale is that you’re depriving it of income in the form of interest payments, so it reserves the right to penalize you to offset that loss. Fortunately, this practice isn’t common, and none of the <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan lenders</a> we review charge borrowers for getting out of debt too quickly.</p><p>However, you should review the fine print of any loan you already have or plan to get to see if it includes a prepayment penalty. If it does, you could see the fee in one of three ways, said Howard Dvorkin, chairman of Debt.com.</p><p>“First, [the lender] can charge you a percentage of your loan balance. That's usually around 2%,” he said. “Second, they can charge you a flat fee. Or third — and worst of all — they can actually charge you all the interest you're saving by paying early.”</p><h2>How to pay off a personal loan early</h2><p>You could pay your personal loan off early if you experience a windfall or otherwise have a large lump sum sitting in the bank. However, Dvorkin said, “You don't have to think so big. You can also pay off your loan early by nibbling away at it every month.”</p><p>Here are some strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Add extra funds to each payment:</strong> Even $10-$20 more per month can reduce your principal balance faster.</li><li><strong>Make payments biweekly:</strong> When you make payments every two weeks, you’ll submit an extra month’s worth by year-end.</li><li><strong>Make additional payments annually or when possible:</strong> For example, use some or all of a work bonus or monetary gift to pay down your debt.</li><li><strong>Increase your income:</strong> Then, put extra money toward your personal loan.</li></ul><h2>Refinance your personal loan</h2><p>When you refinance your personal loan, you take out a new loan to <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/pay-off-debt\">pay off your existing debt</a>. Generally, it may make sense to refinance if <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rates</a> have dropped, or you’d qualify for a lower interest rate because your credit score has increased since you initially borrowed.</p><p>You can refinance a personal loan with another personal loan, or you could use another debt instrument, like a 0% APR credit card balance transfer. In the former scenario, watch out for <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> — even if the interest rate is lower than what you currently pay, an origination fee could make the transaction more expensive. Instead of comparing interest rates, look at the loan’s annual percentage rate (APR) to get a truer measure of cost.</p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR credit card</a> could make sense if you pay off the balance transferred within the promotional period. If not, you could end up paying a higher interest rate than you would have originally. Note that balance transfers usually cost 3% to 5% of the amount transferred, which is added to your credit card balance.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loans/borrower\">Compare Rates Now</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224274":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224274","content":"<p>Taking out a $1,000 loan can vary widely in cost, repayment terms, and what it takes to qualify.

Loans can cost a great deal, so it’s important to explore all your options and make sure you can afford the payments before you sign.</p><ul><li><strong>Pull your credit report: </strong>Your credit score and credit history will affect how large of a loan you qualify for and the interest rates you’re offered, so it’s best to apply for a loan when you have a credit score that enables you to access the most competitive terms. If your credit score is low, it might be worth it to wait and boost your score before applying.</li><li><strong>Your income and expenses: </strong>Additionally, consider your income and expenses. If you have a budget, make sure you have enough to afford a monthly payment. While a loan allows you to access what you need without paying the full amount upfront, there’s still a monthly cost, as well as a long-term one.</li></ul><p>When you’re comparing loans, also take the loan’s APR into account. The annual percentage rate includes your interest rate and fees, expressed as a percentage. The higher your APR, the more you’ll pay over the life of the loan.</p><p><i><strong>Learn More: </strong></i><a href=\"/personal-loan/5k-loans\"><i>$5,000 Personal Loans</i></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"/personal-loan\">Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>$1,000 personal loan</h2><p>Personal loans are a type of <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a> that typically come with a set APR and fixed monthly payments. You can find these loans at banks, credit unions, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>. Personal loans are usually unsecured, meaning you don’t have to <a href=\"/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">provide collateral</a>, like a car or a home that you own, to back the loan.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of each monthly payment and the number of months you will need to repay the loan will be determined prior to you closing the loan, so there should be no surprises.</p><p>Since personal loans rarely require collateral to secure them, the amount and terms you qualify for will depend on your credit score, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a low credit score, a history of missing payments, and existing debt, it will be a challenge to qualify for a loan. You will often still be able to find a personal loan with a low credit score, but the APR will often be very high, and you might not qualify for $1,000, but for a lesser amount.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224282","content":"<h2>$1,000 cash advance</h2><p>Most credit cards will allow you to withdraw cash on your credit line up to a certain limit.&nbsp;</p><p>APRs for credit cards are higher on average than those for personal loans, however, and cash advances often charge even higher rates and fees than normal use of your credit card. Additionally, the amount of cash you can withdraw is usually limited by your credit card company.</p><p>There are also apps that offer fast cash advances and don’t charge interest, but they have negatives to consider as well. While an app can get money in your hands quickly, it often ties repayment to your next payday, giving you a very small window of time to repay what you owe.&nbsp;</p><p>In lieu of interest, these apps usually charge fees. They might seem small, but they can be quite large when analyzed as a percentage of the amount you’re borrowing and the time frame for which you’re borrowing it. Finally, these apps are usually intended for smaller amounts, so it may be difficult to find one that would loan you $1,000.</p><h2>Payday loan</h2><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> is a short-term loan for a small amount that you’re usually expected to pay in full on your next payday. Generally, you’ll leave a check for the amount of the loan plus interest and fees with the payday lender, and they’ll automatically pull the full amount out of your account on your payday.&nbsp;</p><p>These loans often come with very high interest and fees, to such a degree that payday lenders are restricted or outright prohibited in many states. Because of the high cost of borrowing and the short repayment term, these loans can often trap borrowers in a cycle of debt.</p><p>Because some states regulate or ban payday loans, you may not be able to access a payday lender in person or online. Additionally, you may not be able to get a $1,000 payday loan, as many lenders only give payday loans of $500 or less.&nbsp;</p><p>Since these lenders pull the money directly from your account, making them more likely to be able to recoup the money they lend you, they usually don’t check your credit scores or other factors that most traditional lenders consider.</p><h2>Payday alternative loan</h2><p>Since payday loans have such a bad (and often deserved) reputation, federal credit unions came up with a better alternative: <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loans</a>, or PALs.&nbsp;</p><p>These small loans, for amounts between $200 and $2,000, have repayment terms of between one month and a year. The fees and interest credit unions charge you for these loans are capped (typically at $20 and 28%, respectively), making them a more affordable and sustainable option.</p><p>PALs are offered at some federal credit unions — take a look at credit unions in your area and online to see if there’s one for you. Additionally, decisions on PALs are often based on your relationship with the credit union itself, more so than credit, which means PALs may be a good decision if you have a lower credit score.</p><h2>Time to fund a $1,000 loan</h2><p>This will depend on a variety of factors, including the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-types\">type of loan</a> you’re taking out, the time of day you’re applying, and whether you’re getting cash or money deposited into your bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>Payday loans and cash advances can get cash in your hands the same day, and some personal lenders also offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day funding</a>. (Though if you’re opening a new credit card, you will sometimes need to wait for it to arrive to take out cash.) Even PALs and <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a> with longer funding times will rarely take longer than a week to get your money into your account.&nbsp;</p><p>But even lenders that boast same-day funding times can take longer. If you apply later in the day or take a while to submit documentation or complete the application, you may experience a delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes it might happen with the bank account that’s receiving the funds, depending on your bank’s policies about incoming payments. Finally, some lenders have a more time-intensive process — ask your lender about this upfront if the money is needed in a specific time frame.</p><p><i><strong>Keep Reading: </strong></i><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-small-loan\"><i>How to Get a Small Loan</i></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"/personal-loan\">Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>How much will a $1,000 loan cost?</h2><p>There are three main factors that will determine how much borrowing $1,000 will cost you:</p><ul><li><strong>Interest rates: </strong>Your interest rate is a percentage of the total amount you borrow that you pay the lender. Interest rates can be fixed, as they are for most personal loans, or variable, as they are for most credit cards. Fixed interest rates are generally preferable as they will not go up with the market.</li><li><strong>Fees: </strong>Most lenders will charge fees, including <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a>, application fees, and late fees. Origination fees are common for personal loans and are usually a percentage of your total loan amount that is deducted from your loan before the money is sent to you. Payday lenders, cash advance apps, and credit card cash advances can also come with quite expensive fees. PALs can come with an application fee, but it’s limited to $20 and has to be associated with the real cost of processing your application.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\"><strong>Loan terms</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Loan terms are the amount of time it will take to repay your loan. Generally, <a href=\"/personal-loan/long-term-personal-loans\">longer loan terms</a> allow you to make a lower monthly payment, but mean that you end up paying more in interest. It’s usually best to opt for the shortest repayment term possible where you can safely afford the monthly payment.</li></ul><p>Remember, when taking out a loan, you’ll want to consider the APR, which includes both the interest rate and fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224286":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224286","content":"<p>If that seems like a pretty big chunk of your paycheck, you’re not alone — many payday borrowers end up needing to roll over their loan, according to research by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2022.</p><p>The CFPB found that a borrower who took a $300 payday loan could pay $360 in rollover fees over four months and still owe the total original $300.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224290":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224290","content":"<h2>Personal Loans Calculator</h2><p>If you decide to take out a personal loan, use a personal loan calculator to determine interest charges over time.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:7454":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"7454","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"blog-calculator","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224294","content":"<h2>How to qualify for a small loan</h2><p>While payday loans and cash advance apps tie your loan eligibility to your paycheck, most other lenders, including credit card companies, credit unions, <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">banks</a>, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>, will look at your overall financial picture to see if you qualify for a $1,000 loan. Here are some of the things they will consider:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Credit score</strong></a><strong>: </strong>As mentioned above, your credit score is a crucial factor. Borrowers with high credit scores (mid-700s and above) are likely to get the best offers. Credit scores take into account things like your history of making payments on time, which will impact how risky a borrower lenders think you might be.</li><li><strong>Income: </strong>Lenders will also want to get a picture of your income, and will likely ask about your employment and want to see your pay stubs. This will give them another way to determine whether you can take on a $1,000 loan.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\"><strong>Debt-to-income ratio</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A term you might hear is “debt-to-income ratio,” which simply means comparing the total cost of your monthly debt payments to the total amount of your pretax monthly income. Again, this gives the lender a better idea of whether you can reasonably take on another loan.</li></ul><p>To improve your chances of qualifying, it can be worthwhile to boost your credit score, increase your income, or pay down some of your existing debt before applying for a new loan. You can improve your debt-to-income ratio by paying off loans or credit cards you’re currently carrying or increasing your income.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How To Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h3>How to qualify with bad credit</h3><p>If you have bad credit or fair credit, it can be harder to get approved, even for a small personal loan. But there are a few ways to improve your chances. First, consider lenders that specialize in <a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">personal loans for bad credit</a> and have low or no minimum credit score requirements. It may also be worthwhile to seek out a <a href=\"/personal-loan/collateral-loans\">secured personal loan</a> that you can back with collateral — that is, something you own, like a car or home. If you don’t make your payments, the lender can take your collateral, which may make the choice to lend to you a little safer for them.</p><p>Another option is to seek out a personal loan provider that <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">allows a cosigner</a>. A cosigner is someone with a better credit score and debt-to-income ratio who can take on the responsibility of the debt with you, which again can improve your chances of being <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">approved for a loan</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:224298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"224298","content":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"/personal-loan\">Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>Alternative options</h2><p>If a $1,000 loan doesn’t seem like the right choice for you, here are some other options to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Saving: </strong>If you don’t need the $1,000 immediately, or it’s for something you can put off, like a vacation or a wedding, it can be a wise financial choice to wait and save that money rather than borrowing it.</li><li><strong>Sell unneeded items: </strong>If you have items you don’t need with a good resale value, like designer clothes or electronics, you could consider selling those. Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and other websites make it easy to turn unwanted items into cash.</li><li><strong>Take on a side hustle: </strong>There are gigs available that offer low barriers to entry, making it easy to start pulling in money on the side. The average American with a side hustle in 2022 pulled in about $1,000 a month from it, according to a <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/side-hustle-report-2022/\">report by Zapier</a>.</li><li><strong>Borrow from a friend or family member: </strong>If you have a loved one who can lend you the money, consider talking to them about this. If you decide to pursue this option, draw up a mutually agreed-upon repayment plan — and stick to it.</li><li><strong>Seek out financial assistance programs: </strong>Some nonprofits and state and local governments offer financial assistance for those in need, especially for basic needs such as food and housing. Take a look at what’s available in your area.</li></ul>"}},"120":{"ROOT_QUERY":{"__typename":"Query","getTrustpilotData":{"__typename":"Trustpilot","numberOfReviews":8951,"stars":5}}}};

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

According to the company, 90% of Reach personal loans are funded within one day of approval. You can also choose between bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly payment schedules.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's a good choice for debt consolidation and credit card refinancing, but borrowers with excellent credit may not find the lowest rates with Reach. The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

It offers personal loans for a variety of uses, including debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, and home improvement, with funding as soon as the next business day. You can also manage your account using LendingPoint's mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With low starting APRs and a mid-600s credit score minimum, LendingPoint is best suited for borrowers with fair credit or a limited credit history looking for smaller loans. Some borrowers with good credit may also benefit from a LendingPoint loan.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You should only take out a loan if you are certain you will be able to repay it on time and in full. Loans can cost a great deal, so it’s important to explore all your options and make sure you can afford the payments before you sign.</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Pull your credit report: </strong>Your credit score and credit history will affect how large of a loan you qualify for and the interest rates you’re offered, so it’s best to apply for a loan when you have a credit score that enables you to access the most competitive terms. If your credit score is low, it might be worth it to wait and boost your score before applying.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Your income and expenses: </strong>Additionally, consider your income and expenses. If you have a budget, make sure you have enough to afford a monthly payment. While a loan allows you to access what you need without paying the full amount upfront, there’s still a monthly cost, as well as a long-term one.</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When you’re comparing loans, also take the loan’s APR into account. The annual percentage rate includes your interest rate and fees, expressed as a percentage. The higher your APR, the more you’ll pay over the life of the loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Learn More: </strong></em><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="5k-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">$5,000 Personal Loans</em></a></p><p class="mb-16 align-center styles_body__wG6cR"><a class="btn btn-warning styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="-personal-loan">$1,000 personal loan</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Personal loans are a type of <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-is-an-installment-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">installment loan</a> that typically come with a set APR and fixed monthly payments.

Personal loans are usually unsecured, meaning you don’t have to <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="collateral-for-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">provide collateral</a>, like a car or a home that you own, to back the loan. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The amount of each monthly payment and the number of months you will need to repay the loan will be determined prior to you closing the loan, so there should be no surprises.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Since personal loans rarely require collateral to secure them, the amount and terms you qualify for will depend on your credit score, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you have a low credit score, a history of missing payments, and existing debt, it will be a challenge to qualify for a loan. You will often still be able to find a personal loan with a low credit score, but the APR will often be very high, and you might not qualify for $1,000, but for a lesser amount. </p></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="-cash-advance">$1,000 cash advance</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Most credit cards will allow you to withdraw cash on your credit line up to a certain limit. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">APRs for credit cards are higher on average than those for personal loans, however, and cash advances often charge even higher rates and fees than normal use of your credit card. Additionally, the amount of cash you can withdraw is usually limited by your credit card company.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">There are also apps that offer fast cash advances and don’t charge interest, but they have negatives to consider as well. While an app can get money in your hands quickly, it often ties repayment to your next payday, giving you a very small window of time to repay what you owe. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">In lieu of interest, these apps usually charge fees. They might seem small, but they can be quite large when analyzed as a percentage of the amount you’re borrowing and the time frame for which you’re borrowing it. Finally, these apps are usually intended for smaller amounts, so it may be difficult to find one that would loan you $1,000.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="payday-loan">Payday loan</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-are-payday-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">payday loan</a> is a short-term loan for a small amount that you’re usually expected to pay in full on your next payday. Generally, you’ll leave a check for the amount of the loan plus interest and fees with the payday lender, and they’ll automatically pull the full amount out of your account on your payday. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">These loans often come with very high interest and fees, to such a degree that payday lenders are restricted or outright prohibited in many states. Because of the high cost of borrowing and the short repayment term, these loans can often trap borrowers in a cycle of debt.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Because some states regulate or ban payday loans, you may not be able to access a payday lender in person or online. Additionally, you may not be able to get a $1,000 payday loan, as many lenders only give payday loans of $500 or less. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Since these lenders pull the money directly from your account, making them more likely to be able to recoup the money they lend you, they usually don’t check your credit scores or other factors that most traditional lenders consider.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="payday-alternative-loan">Payday alternative loan</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Since payday loans have such a bad (and often deserved) reputation, federal credit unions came up with a better alternative: <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="payday-alternative-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">payday alternative loans</a>, or PALs. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">These small loans, for amounts between $200 and $2,000, have repayment terms of between one month and a year. The fees and interest credit unions charge you for these loans are capped (typically at $20 and 28%, respectively), making them a more affordable and sustainable option.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">PALs are offered at some federal credit unions — take a look at credit unions in your area and online to see if there’s one for you. Additionally, decisions on PALs are often based on your relationship with the credit union itself, more so than credit, which means PALs may be a good decision if you have a lower credit score.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="time-to-fund-a--loan">Time to fund a $1,000 loan</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">This will depend on a variety of factors, including the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-types.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">type of loan</a> you’re taking out, the time of day you’re applying, and whether you’re getting cash or money deposited into your bank account. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Payday loans and cash advances can get cash in your hands the same day, and some personal lenders also offer <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="same-day-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">same-day funding</a>. (Though if you’re opening a new credit card, you will sometimes need to wait for it to arrive to take out cash.) Even PALs and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loans</a> with longer funding times will rarely take longer than a week to get your money into your account. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">But even lenders that boast same-day funding times can take longer. If you apply later in the day or take a while to submit documentation or complete the application, you may experience a delay. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Sometimes it might happen with the bank account that’s receiving the funds, depending on your bank’s policies about incoming payments. Finally, some lenders have a more time-intensive process — ask your lender about this upfront if the money is needed in a specific time frame.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Keep Reading: </strong></em><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="how-to-get-small-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><em class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">How to Get a Small Loan</em></a></p><p class="mb-16 align-center styles_body__wG6cR"><a class="btn btn-warning styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-much-will-a--loan-cost">How much will a $1,000 loan cost?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">There are three main factors that will determine how much borrowing $1,000 will cost you:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Interest rates: </strong>Your interest rate is a percentage of the total amount you borrow that you pay the lender. Interest rates can be fixed, as they are for most personal loans, or variable, as they are for most credit cards. Fixed interest rates are generally preferable as they will not go up with the market.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Fees: </strong>Most lenders will charge fees, including <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="origination-fee.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">origination fees</a>, application fees, and late fees. Origination fees are common for personal loans and are usually a percentage of your total loan amount that is deducted from your loan before the money is sent to you. Payday lenders, cash advance apps, and credit card cash advances can also come with quite expensive fees. PALs can come with an application fee, but it’s limited to $20 and has to be associated with the real cost of processing your application.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-term-length.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Loan terms</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">: </strong>Loan terms are the amount of time it will take to repay your loan.

The 1% origination fee would be automatically deducted, and you would receive $990. Over the next year, you would make a monthly payment of $88.38, and the total cost of the loan would be $70.58 in interest, or 12.92% APR. You would end up paying $1,060.58 overall.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">On the other hand, you could take out a payday loan for the same amount. This $1,000 payday loan comes with a 400% APR (a typical rate) and has to be repaid in two weeks. In two weeks, you will need to pay the full amount due: $1,153.42. That means the cost of borrowing $1,000 for two weeks is $153.42. </p></section></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If that seems like a pretty big chunk of your paycheck, you’re not alone — many payday borrowers end up needing to roll over their loan, according to research by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2022.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The CFPB found that a borrower who took a $300 payday loan could pay $360 in rollover fees over four months and still owe the total original $300.</p></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="personal-loans-calculator">Personal Loans Calculator</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you decide to take out a personal loan, use a personal loan calculator to determine interest charges over time.</p></section><div id="partners-widget-block-7454" class="PartnersWidget_partnersWidgetContainer__5UM2H partners-widget-container"></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-small-loan">How to qualify for a small loan</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">While payday loans and cash advance apps tie your loan eligibility to your paycheck, most other lenders, including credit card companies, credit unions, <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="best-banks-for-personal-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">banks</a>, and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="best-online-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">online lenders</a>, will look at your overall financial picture to see if you qualify for a $1,000 loan.

Borrowers with high credit scores (mid-700s and above) are likely to get the best offers. Credit scores take into account things like your history of making payments on time, which will impact how risky a borrower lenders think you might be.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Income: </strong>Lenders will also want to get a picture of your income, and will likely ask about your employment and want to see your pay stubs. This will give them another way to determine whether you can take on a $1,000 loan.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="debt-to-income-ratio.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Debt-to-income ratio</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">: </strong>A term you might hear is “debt-to-income ratio,” which simply means comparing the total cost of your monthly debt payments to the total amount of your pretax monthly income. Again, this gives the lender a better idea of whether you can reasonably take on another loan.</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">To improve your chances of qualifying, it can be worthwhile to boost your credit score, increase your income, or pay down some of your existing debt before applying for a new loan.

For example, Bob's Discount Furniture offers a few options through its leasing and lending partners that don't require a credit score.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany furniture retailers also offer deferred interest promotions when you apply for a store-branded credit card. This might be a good option if you plan to buy all your furniture from the same store and you're confident you can pay the balance in full within the promotional period. For example, the Wayfair credit card allows you to avoid interest for up to 24 months on purchases of $2,999 or more. But if you're unable to pay off the balance within that time frame, you'll be charged interest from the date of purchase at a high variable APR. Deferred financing promotions are common and typically have higher minimum purchase amounts for longer deferred interest periods.\u003c/p\u003e"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252874":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252874","content":"\u003ch3\u003e0% APR credit card\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome credit card issuers offer a 0% APR promotional period for new cardholders. Unlike store credit cards, issuers like Wells Fargo and Chase allow you to buy furniture at any retailer that accepts that card brand, and you can avoid interest for up to 21 months. These promotions are typically zero-interest promotions rather than deferred interest promotions. This means you won't be charged interest on the full amount if you don't pay it off within the promotional period. Instead, interest starts accruing at the end of the promotional period and only on the remaining amount you owe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBNPL\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuy now, pay later (BNPL) companies like Klarna and Affirm provide point-of-sale financing at many furniture retailers.

Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request.

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees.

You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone.

For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5. Since the loan is due in two weeks, the cost is equivalent to an 87% APR.

Fortunately, this practice isn’t common, and none of the \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan\"\u003epersonal loan lenders\u003c/a\u003e we review charge borrowers for getting out of debt too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, you should review the fine print of any loan you already have or plan to get to see if it includes a prepayment penalty. If it does, you could see the fee in one of three ways, said Howard Dvorkin, chairman of Debt.com.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“First, [the lender] can charge you a percentage of your loan balance.
