    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I borrow money without a high interest rate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Traditional personal or home equity loans typically let you borrow money at much lower rates than <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">credit cards</a>. They can also be used for a variety of purposes. Credit cards with a 0% intro APR can also be a good choice if you’re confident you can pay off the balance before the promotional period expires.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are zero-interest loans worth it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Zero-interest loans can be worth it in the right situation. They provide quick access to funds, save money on interest charges, and have low eligibility barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, most 0% interest personal loans have short repayment periods that result in high monthly payments. Leslie Tayne, an award-winning debt-relief attorney and personal finance expert, says that these loans are best for people with a solid repayment plan who are confident they have the resources to pay off the loan.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score is needed for a no-interest loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The score you need depends on the lender and loan type. Some BNPL lenders won’t check your credit. Others recommend a score above 700. Car dealerships typically require excellent credit to qualify for a 0% loan. Some may want to see 800+ credit scores.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if I pay late on a 0% interest loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>For most 0% interest loans, you’re charged a late fee. If you miss payments, BNPL lenders may also freeze your account or sell your debt to a debt collector. Debt collectors may report you to credit agencies, affecting your credit score. While more common with credit cards, it’s possible some no-interest loans may charge you any interest that’s been deferred.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where can I get an interest-free loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Genuine no-interest loans are hard to find with traditional lenders. Instead, you’ll see them offered by universities, nonprofits, BNPL programs, and new car dealerships. You may also find them with other businesses offering in-house financing.</p>"}}]}

Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Unlike student loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">college scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> don't have to be repaid - which makes them a great way to pay for school. There's no limit to how many scholarships and grants you can get, so it's a good idea to apply for as many as you can.</p><p>Many scholarships and grants are specifically designed for veterinary students, such as the:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.akc.org/press-releases/american-kennel-club-announces-recipients-2021-veterinary-scholarships/\">American Kennel Club (AKC) Veterinary Outreach Scholarships</a>: For vet students who have participated in AKC events and programs; depending on the sponsor, students might be awarded up to $10,000</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/merck-animal-health-scholarship/\">Merck Animal Health Veterinary Student Scholarship Program</a>: Awards $5,000 scholarships to second- and third-year vet students with financial need</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/national-regional-scholarships/\">The American Veterinary Medical Foundation scholarships</a>: Offers a list of available scholarships and requirements for vet students</li></ul><h3>2. Fill out the FAFSA</h3><p>Fill out the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> before the deadline. For the 2025-26 academic year, you have until June 30, 2026. Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine what federal student loans and other financial aid you qualify for. Keep in mind that some aid is given on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's a good idea to submit the FAFSA as early as possible.</p><p>You might also qualify for school-based scholarships depending on your FAFSA results.</p><h3>3. Get a job or qualify for a work-study program</h3><p>Working during school could help you cover some of your school expenses. If you have financial need, you might qualify for the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study program</a>, which provides part-time <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">jobs for college students</a>.</p><p>These jobs are often on campus, though in some cases, you might work for a private nonprofit or for-profit employer that has partnered with your school.</p><h3>4. Apply for federal student loans</h3><p>If you need to borrow for school, it's usually best to rely on federal student loans first. This is because these loans come with federal benefits and protections, such as access to income-driven repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs.</p><p>There are two main types of federal student loans that vet school students might qualify for:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized loans:</strong> These loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students regardless of financial need. Unlike undergraduate subsidized loans, you're responsible for all of the interest that accrues on unsubsidized loans.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans:</strong> These loans are available to students who want to pay for grad school or a professional program. Keep in mind, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">grad PLUS loans</a> usually come with higher interest rates than other federal loans. They also require a credit check.</li></ul><p>After you submit the FAFSA, your school will send you a financial aid award letter detailing what federal student loans and other financial aid you're eligible for. You can then decide which aid you'd like to accept.</p><h3>5. Apply for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program</h3><p>Check into the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) after graduation. It's a federal program designed to help with a national shortage of veterinarians in rural and agricultural areas. Specialized vets focus on food animals, like cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry.</p><p>The VMLRP offers up to $40,000 per year toward eligible government and commercial student loan repayment to eligible veterinarians in return for their service in high-priority veterinary shortages for three years. These are the requirements:</p><ul><li>Have at least $15,000 in qualified veterinary educational loan debt</li><li>Hold a DVM (or equivalent) from an accredited school</li><li>Start within 90 days of award notification in a designated veterinary shortage situation</li><li>Meet all <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.9\">other requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.10\">regulations</a></li></ul><h3>6. Private loans for vet school</h3><p>After you've exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> could help fill any financial gaps left over. While these loans don't come with federal protections, they do offer some benefits of their own - for example, you can apply at any time, and you might be able to borrow more than you'd get with a federal loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable:898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable","id":"898","refiLenders":[],"isLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogLenderType","name":"Abe","slug":"abe","variableRate":true,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"660","loanTerms":"5, 7, 10, 15, 20","loanAmount":"$1,000 up to school-certified cost of attendance (aggregate $225,000 limit)","discounts":"Autopay, Good Payment Behavior","cosignerRelease":"12 months","repaymentOptions":"Full deferral, immediate, fixed/flat, and interest only","fees":"None","degrees":"Undergraduate, graduate, certificate, advanced degrees","vertical":"inschool","lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/05cbce1b-b2d8-4403-9a7b-233da5a6d1b2","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.3,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/abe-student-loans-review","bestFor":"Best for Payment Relief Options","expertInsights":"<p>Few private lenders match the borrower protections Abe offers.

It can be used for paying off credit card debt, or any debts that carry interest.</p><p>To use this method, look at your revolving credit (such as credit cards) and installment consumer loans (personal loans, student loans, or auto loans). Determine which has the highest interest rate, and pay that one off first. Once it’s paid off, you can focus on the next highest interest rate. You’ll save money because you’re paying off the loan that is costing you the most money over time.</p><p>The debt avalanche method is one of many <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management</a> techniques that personal finance experts recommend. The debt snowball method involves paying off the smallest balance first and then going after the next smallest. Other methods take into account saving for retirement. The debt avalanche method, on the other hand, focuses solely on interest to save you money.</p><h2>How does the debt avalanche method work?</h2><p>The debt avalanche method is a three-step process that you repeat until your debt is paid off. Here’s how it works.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Identifying high-interest debts</h3><p>Look at all your debts and determine which one has the highest interest. This could include:</p><ul><li>Credit cards</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-a-personal-loan\">Personal loans</a></li><li><a href=\"/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-200k\">Student loans</a></li><li>Auto loans</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222282","content":"<h3>2. Prioritizing payments</h3><p>Come up with a game plan that prioritizes the debt with the highest interest rate. Then, rank your remaining debts from highest to lowest. Your hierarchy will determine the order you pay off accounts in the coming months.</p><h3>3. Making minimum payments on other debts</h3><p>While you’re putting additional money toward your highest-interest debt, only make the minimum payment on each of your other debts. Don’t fall behind or miss payments, as this would hurt your credit score, but instead, do the bare minimum to keep each of your other accounts current and in good standing. Any additional cash you have each month should be put toward the debt with the highest interest until it’s paid off.</p><h2>Benefits of the debt avalanche method</h2><p>“The debt avalanche method makes sense financially,” says Melanie Musson from Clearsurance. “You minimize the amount of money you waste on interest when you pay off the highest interest debt first.”</p><p>Aaron Razon, a personal finance expert and writer for Coupon Snake, adds: “The most outstanding benefit of the debt avalanche method is not just the fact that it helps you save on interest payments, but that it also helps you realize how much money you are losing on interest payments over time, and in my experience, I have found that this realization plays a crucial role in an individual's financial decisions. The truth is that just very few people understand how much financial progress their debt load is costing them.”</p><h3>Interest savings over time</h3><p>How much you’ll save in interest depends on how much you can put toward each payment each month. The more money you put toward your monthly payments, the better. You can use an online debt calculator to see how much you can save and how long it will take to pay off based on different monthly payments.</p><h3>Faster debt repayment</h3><p>By focusing all of your additional resources on your highest-interest debt first, not only will you save more money in interest, but you also might get out of debt faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Because each person’s budget is unique, enter your balances, minimum payments, and interest rate information into a debt payoff calculator. Determine your total budget for monthly debt payments. The calculator will tell you how long it will take you to get out of debt, and it will tell you how much you’ll save over time by using the debt avalanche method.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">How to Create a Budget: A Step-By-Step Guide</a></p><h3>Improved financial health</h3><p>You’ll see a few benefits from paying off your debts. The first is that you’ll have more cash each month as various debts are paid off. As you lower your overall debt, your credit score will improve, and you’ll be able to put more money into savings. Whether you’re building a rainy day fund, planning an upcoming vacation, or saving for your retirement, you'll have more money to put toward your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>A higher credit score will be useful if you need to take out a large loan in the future, such as to buy a house.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222286":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222286","content":"<p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-save-money\">How To Save Money: Strategies for Every Budget</a></p><h2>Debt avalanche vs. debt snowball: Which is right for you?</h2><p>You may have also heard of the debt snowball method — both the snowball and avalanche techniques help you pay off debt faster. The debt snowball method takes a different approach to paying off debt that you may want to consider.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key differences between the methods</h3><p>The avalanche method focuses on paying off the debts with the highest interest first. Once it’s paid off, you shift your extra monthly payments to the debt with the next highest interest rate.</p><p>The <a href=\"/personal-finance/debt-snowball-method\">snowball method</a>, on the other hand, focuses on paying off the debt with the lowest balance. Once it’s paid off, take the monthly payment that would have gone toward it and pay off the next lowest balance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pros and cons of each approach</h3><p>“The debt snowball method gives you quick wins, which can help keep you motivated,” says Joseph Camberato, CEO and founder of National Business Capital. “Paying off small balances one by one feels rewarding and gives you momentum. But the downside is that it's usually the more expensive route. Focusing on small debts first means your high-interest debt keeps racking up charges, which could cost you way more in the long run. If one of those smaller debts has a high interest rate, it can quickly spiral into a bigger problem.\"</p><p>The opposite is true for the debt avalanche method. While you’re saving money, it can take time to gain momentum, especially if your highest-interest debt also has one of your higher balances.</p><h3>Choosing the best strategy for your situation</h3><p>You can use either of these methods or a combination of both, depending on your financial goals. You may have one or two smaller debts that would be quick and easy wins and provide additional money you could put toward your highest-interest debts once they’re paid off.&nbsp;</p><p>You can still be flexible, but the most important step is to develop a strategy. Use a debt calculator or speak with a financial adviser if you feel overwhelmed. The <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has information about what to look for in credit counseling, as well as reputable online sources to help you search for a counseling service.</p><p>You may also want to consider a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">debt consolidation loan</a> or a <a href=\"/mortgage/refinance-mortgage-to-pay-off-debt\">mortgage refinance</a>.</p><h2>Tips for successfully implementing the debt avalanche method</h2><p>If you’re following the debt avalanche method, you need to create a plan and rank your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. Once you’ve done that, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Create a realistic budget</h3><p>Set aside money for unexpected expenses. You may have to pick up dinner one night, or you may have to spend a little more on groceries. Expect hiccups. Give yourself enough wiggle room in each of your spending categories so that the additional cash you put toward your debt is manageable for the long term.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Stay disciplined with payments</h3><p>It may be easier during some months to throw all of your additional cash at your debts, while it may be a struggle during other months. Stick to the plan as closely as you can, but know that there may be rough patches along the way. The key is to remain consistent. If you set a realistic budget at the outset, that will help you maintain consistency and reach your goals.</p><h3>3. Monitor progress regularly</h3><p>It’s important to keep track of your progress to help keep yourself motivated and to help ensure you're doing what’s best for your financial situation. You may want to play around with some debt payoff calculators as each debt is paid off to see if the numbers still add up. Remember, there can be flexibility.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319282","content":"<p>Cash advance apps, also called loan apps, make it easy to get small short-term loans, fast, regardless of your credit score.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors.

The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost.

In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs.

Lender requirements can vary, but the process of applying and securing a home loan is generally the same across most private lenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Before approving a home loan, lenders assess your financial health to determine whether you can afford the loan and are likely to repay it. The mortgage qualification process typically includes the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Prequalification:</strong> Many lenders allow potential borrowers to prequalify for a mortgage loan. During prequalification, lenders perform a less stringent review of your finances to determine how much you can borrow. Afterward, lenders provide estimated loan interest rates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan application:</strong> Prequalification doesn't guarantee approval. You must formally submit a loan application, which includes sharing detailed personal and financial information with the lender.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> The underwriting process is a thorough analysis of your financial health and personal details, including your creditworthiness, income, and assets.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Approval or denial:</strong> Once the lender processes your application, you'll receive an approval or denial based on the lender's assessment.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In some cases, you can prequalify or get <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">pre-approved for a home loan</a> online within minutes.

This starts with reviewing your credit profile, evaluating your current financial situation, gathering personal information, and collecting the documents you'll need during the loan application process.&nbsp;</p><h2>Check your credit score and credit report</h2><p>It's important to understand your credit profile before you begin applying for a home loan. Lenders use your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-credit-score-impacts-mortgage-rate\">credit score</a> to assess how likely you are to repay the loan. Your credit report contains detailed information used by lenders during the underwriting process, including your payment history, number of credit accounts, and negative marks, which could be red flags.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:204306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"204306","content":"<p>Some banks and credit card issuers offer free credit score access.

No-interest loans exist in various forms, such as “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) apps and cash advance apps. However, “no-interest” or “zero-interest” doesn't necessarily mean zero cost.</p><p>These loans may come with strings attached, and in some cases, could cost more than a loan that charges standard interest. Here's a closer look at 0% interest loans and what you need to know.</p><h2>Is it possible to get an interest-free loan?</h2><p>Yes, it's possible to get interest-free loans, but most are for short-term financing needs and need to be repaid within two weeks to a few months. Loan amounts are typically limited as well. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\"><strong>Buy now, pay later</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some retailers and financial services companies offer BNPL options. As long as you make payments as agreed — often in four biweekly payments — you can avoid paying interest. However, BNPL loans may charge fees for late or missed payments.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Apps like Earnin and Klover use your next paycheck as collateral to lend small amounts of cash. These apps typically don't charge interest but may have fees, such as a monthly membership or instant transfer fees. More importantly, because of short repayment periods and fees, the cost of using a cash advance app could be the equivalent of paying more than 300% APR.</li><li><strong>Payroll advance financing:</strong> You might be able to get a paycheck advance or earned wage access through your employer. These advances may not be 100% interest-free, but if interest is charged, it's typically much lower than other short-term options such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Payment plans from healthcare providers or organizations:</strong> Healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and physicians' offices, might be willing to create an interest-free payment plan for you to encourage payment. Healthcare payment financing services offer loans or lines of credit with no or low interest, although some might charge deferred interest.</li><li><strong>Educational scholarships and emergency student loan programs:</strong> Some schools offer interest-free emergency student loans or interest-free scholarships through financial aid offices and scholarship programs. However, loan amounts may be small, and a co-signer may be required.</li><li><strong>Carmaker auto financing:</strong> Occasionally, some car manufacturers may offer interest-free 0% financing on new cars. Only those with very good or excellent credit are likely to get approved for 0% APR financing.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\"><strong>0% APR credit cards</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some credit card issuers offer introductory 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers, with introductory periods lasting up to 21 months before the regular APR applies. Remember that you'll need to pay for the purchase or balance transfer in full before the introductory offer ends to avoid interest.</li></ul><p>Some credit cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, that is added to the card's balance. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% balance transfer fee would cost $150.</p><p>If you're a student, ask your school about emergency student loans. For example, the Marshall University Emergency Loan Program provides one loan of up to $250 per semester if you have a financial emergency.</p><p>Moreover, nonprofits like the Jewish Free Loan Association offer emergency, business, education, and wellness loans with 0% interest or fees to all types of borrowers. You can get up to $15,000 for a personal emergency loan with two qualified guarantors.

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees. Terms typically range from a couple of weeks to 21 months, but high-ticket items, like cars, may have terms of 48 months or more.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, say you purchased a new car for $30,000 with a $5,000 down payment and 0% financing for 48 months. Paying off the remaining $25,000 balance would mean making 48 monthly payments of $521. Although you can avoid interest with a 0% APR financing if you repay on time, missed payments could lead to cancellation of the zero-interest offer. You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.</p><p>Another example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone. With the typical BNPL loan, you’d pay $250 upfront and agree to make three more biweekly payments of $250. You’ll likely be charged a late fee if you&nbsp;miss a payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Both these examples might truly be no-cost loans. But some no-interest loans are high-cost. For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5. Since the loan is due in two weeks, the cost is equivalent to an 87% APR.

No-interest loans exist in various forms, such as “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) apps and cash advance apps. However, “no-interest” or “zero-interest” doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean zero cost.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">These loans may come with strings attached, and in some cases, could cost more than a loan that charges standard interest. Here&#x27;s a closer look at 0% interest loans and what you need to know.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="is-it-possible-to-get-an-interest-free-loan">Is it possible to get an interest-free loan?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Yes, it&#x27;s possible to get interest-free loans, but most are for short-term financing needs and need to be repaid within two weeks to a few months. Loan amounts are typically limited as well. Here are some examples:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="buy-now-pay-later.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Buy now, pay later</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> Some retailers and financial services companies offer BNPL options. As long as you make payments as agreed — often in four biweekly payments — you can avoid paying interest. However, BNPL loans may charge fees for late or missed payments.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Cash advance apps:</strong> Apps like Earnin and Klover use your next paycheck as collateral to lend small amounts of cash. These apps typically don&#x27;t charge interest but may have fees, such as a monthly membership or instant transfer fees. More importantly, because of short repayment periods and fees, the cost of using a cash advance app could be the equivalent of paying more than 300% APR.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payroll advance financing:</strong> You might be able to get a paycheck advance or earned wage access through your employer. These advances may not be 100% interest-free, but if interest is charged, it&#x27;s typically much lower than other short-term options such as <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-are-payday-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">payday loans</a> and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="pawn-shop-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">pawnshop loans</a>.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payment plans from healthcare providers or organizations:</strong> Healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and physicians&#x27; offices, might be willing to create an interest-free payment plan for you to encourage payment. Healthcare payment financing services offer loans or lines of credit with no or low interest, although some might charge deferred interest.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Educational scholarships and emergency student loan programs:</strong> Some schools offer interest-free emergency student loans or interest-free scholarships through financial aid offices and scholarship programs. However, loan amounts may be small, and a co-signer may be required.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Carmaker auto financing:</strong> Occasionally, some car manufacturers may offer interest-free 0% financing on new cars. Only those with very good or excellent credit are likely to get approved for 0% APR financing.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">0% APR credit cards</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> Some credit card issuers offer introductory 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers, with introductory periods lasting up to 21 months before the regular APR applies. Remember that you&#x27;ll need to pay for the purchase or balance transfer in full before the introductory offer ends to avoid interest.</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some credit cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, that is added to the card&#x27;s balance. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% balance transfer fee would cost $150.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you&#x27;re a student, ask your school about emergency student loans. For example, the Marshall University Emergency Loan Program provides one loan of up to $250 per semester if you have a financial emergency.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Moreover, nonprofits like the Jewish Free Loan Association offer emergency, business, education, and wellness loans with 0% interest or fees to all types of borrowers. You can get up to $15,000 for a personal emergency loan with two qualified guarantors. Guarantors are similar to cosigners and agree to cover your debt if you can&#x27;t repay it.</p></section><div class="marketing-banner_marketingBanner__XduWa" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, var(--green100), var(--secondary300))"><div class="marketing-banner_bannerContainer__sA1uH" style="background:linear-gradient(var(--green100), var(--secondary300))"><div class="marketing-banner_content__IMZAR"><h3 class="heading semiBold mb-4 neutral700">Get your financial goals on track</h3><p class="mb-16 secondary700">Free credit score, automatic debt tracking, and goal setting all in one place.</p><a href="../login3956.html?redirectTo=%2Fhub%2Ffinancial-tools" class="inlineFlex roundEdges semiBold borderSecondary500 styles_borderSecondary500__68Un5 styles_bgSecondary500__uYdTQ bgSecondary500 styles_small__XWwen bodySmall styles_cta__2cSxp marketing-banner_cta__li0H2" aria-disabled="false">Get Started</a></div><div class="marketing-banner_imageContainer__RGzPp"><img src="https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/95cb9c03-4b52-48e6-96e0-20999155becb"/></div></div></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="interest-free-loans-vs-personal-loans">Interest-free loans vs. personal loans</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you prefer a more straightforward way of borrowing money, consider taking out a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan</a>.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees. Terms typically range from a couple of weeks to 21 months, but high-ticket items, like cars, may have terms of 48 months or more. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For example, say you purchased a new car for $30,000 with a $5,000 down payment and 0% financing for 48 months. Paying off the remaining $25,000 balance would mean making 48 monthly payments of $521. Although you can avoid interest with a 0% APR financing if you repay on time, missed payments could lead to cancellation of the zero-interest offer. You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Another example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone. With the typical BNPL loan, you’d pay $250 upfront and agree to make three more biweekly payments of $250. You’ll likely be charged a late fee if you miss a payment. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Both these examples might truly be no-cost loans. But some no-interest loans are high-cost. For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5.

Here’s more on each. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Short repayment periods</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">No-interest loans can be challenging to repay because some have short payback periods. Longer-term loans, like personal loans, often have <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-term-length.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">years-long repayment periods</a>, which can mean much lower payments. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For instance, if you take out a $500 cash advance via a cash app to cover an emergency expense, the entire $500 would be due with your next paycheck. If, on the other hand, you took out a $500 loan with a one-year repayment term at 28% APR, your monthly payment would be only $48.</p></section><div id="partners-widget-block-9862" class="PartnersWidget_partnersWidgetContainer__5UM2H partners-widget-container"></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Deferred interest</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">With some credit cards or in-house financing offers, you pay 0% interest on your purchase only if you pay the balance within a certain timeframe, such as 12 months. If you don’t, you could be charged all of the interest that you expected to be deferred. Interest will continue accruing on your outstanding balance at these high rates until the loan is paid off. </p></section><div class="styles_basicBox__TOi7t mb-32"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Warning:</strong> Making only the minimum payment on your loan may not be enough to fully pay it off before the 0% interest rate expires — which means you could be charged the entire amount of deferred interest once the promotion ends. If you have a deferred-interest loan, divide your purchase amount by the promotional period (12 months, for example) to know how much you actually need to pay per month to pay off the balance in full. </p></section></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Risk of repeat borrowing</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some types of interest-free loans are small and easy to obtain, which could lead to overuse.
