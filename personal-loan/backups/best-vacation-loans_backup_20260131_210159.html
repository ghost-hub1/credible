(Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive). The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers. However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in J.D.

Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home.

(Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.  Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.  Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed.

It can also shape your overall college experience. Beyond dorm vs. apartment costs, here are some additional factors to weigh:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Convenience:</strong>&nbsp;Living on campus offers easy access to classes, clubs, academic resources, and other facilities. If you move off campus, you may need&nbsp;transportation, and commuting to and from school can take extra time. \"When you stay on campus, typically it is easier to get to your classes and be more involved with the college and campus life,\" says Brian Safdari, CEO and founder of College Planning Experts. “You can stay focused on your academics, classes, and college life.”</li><li><strong>Independence:</strong> Moving off campus offers more autonomy and the opportunity to develop independent living skills that benefit you later in life. \"Students living off campus often trade the convenience and security of a residence hall for the flexibility and privacy of their own place,\" says Mueller.</li><li><strong>Privacy:</strong>&nbsp;With off-campus housing, you can usually have your own room and live alone or with roommates you choose. In a dorm, you're often sharing a room and may live with a roommate the university assigns you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Social life:</strong>&nbsp;Living in a dorm can be a more social experience and foster a sense of community. It may also be easier to engage with extracurriculars and other campus activities. If you live far away, you might feel isolated, especially if you don't have roommates. On the flip side, you might appreciate living in a quieter area away from the hustle and bustle of campus life.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> College campuses typically provide security and other useful resources to support students. Consider the safety of your area and building when choosing where to live off campus.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How to budget for housing as a college student</h2><p>Budgeting for housing as a college student can help you avoid surprises and stay on top of costs.&nbsp;</p><p>“On-campus housing costs are typically due upfront at the start of the academic year or term, whereas off-campus housing will typically be a monthly expense,” says Austin. “Knowing these due dates and payment options is vital in budgeting.”</p><p>Here are a few tips for preparing financially:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Compare your options:</strong>&nbsp;Research your various housing options, such as an on-campus dorm room or off-campus apartment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Estimate your housing costs:</strong>&nbsp;Estimate total housing costs for your preferred living environment, including transportation and utilities if you're living off campus. Colleges provide a cost of attendance estimate to use as a starting point, but adjust the numbers to your lifestyle&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Create a budget:</strong>&nbsp;Write down your income and expenses to get a big-picture view of your finances and set limits so you don't spend beyond your means.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Track your spending:</strong>&nbsp;This step helps you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">stick to your student budget</a> for housing and other living costs. You can use a spreadsheet, pen and paper, or a budgeting app to monitor your spending.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Plan for upfront expenses:</strong>&nbsp;Your first month may cost extra if you have to pay for furniture, a security deposit, or other setup costs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Look for ways to cut costs:&nbsp;</strong>Consider finding roommates, opting for groceries over a meal plan, or moving to an affordable neighborhood.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“Students should establish a budget each year and track their budget monthly to make sure they are managing their costs and won’t run out of funds before the year is over,” says Mueller. “It’s also a good habit that will serve them well after they graduate from college.”</p><p>There are a variety of ways to pay for college housing, including grants, scholarships, work-study, income from a part-time job, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow\">student loans</a>.

If you can secure a significantly lower rate (such as a percentage point or more), it might be a good time to refinance.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Financial goals:</strong> Determine whether refinancing aligns with your short- and long-term financial goals. Will lower monthly payments, a shorter loan term, or access to additional cash help you reach your goals without negatively impacting your situation?</li><li><strong>Potential savings:</strong> Determine how long it will take to recoup the costs of refinancing. If it takes longer to recover these costs than you plan to stay in your home, refinancing may not be the right choice.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“You typically want to refinance for one of two reasons: You'd like to tap into your home's equity or you're looking for a lower interest rate,” says Noah Damsky, CFA, managing partner at Marina Wealth Advisors. “Compare your existing mortgage interest rate to the refinance interest rate, but ask for a no-closing-cost refinance, which rolls the closing costs into the loan balance. This shows an apples-to-apples comparison of the true monthly cost of the mortgage so you can compare your options. Maybe, on the surface, you're saving 0.25% on the refinance and it sounds like a great deal, but when you roll the closing costs into the new loan, you're actually paying more and it's easier to see because the interest rate and monthly payment increased.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:204602":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"204602","content":"<h2>Factors to consider before refinancing</h2><p>Refinancing your mortgage is a major financial decision. It requires careful thought and planning. Several details can impact your ability to qualify for a new loan and determine how much you'll actually save.&nbsp;</p><p>The following factors can have a significant impact on your decision and financial success:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Lenders typically offer the best refinance rates to borrowers with high credit scores.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> Lenders compare your monthly debt payments to your income to predict whether you can afford monthly mortgage payments. A lower DTI increases your chances of approval.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Home equity:</strong> Typically, lenders require at least 20% equity in your home for a conventional mortgage refinance. Depending on the type of refinance loan you choose, you may be restricted on how much of your equity you can access.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Refinance costs:</strong> Factor in all of the costs involved with refinancing, like closing costs, appraisal fees, and other expenses.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Long-term goals:</strong> Consider whether refinancing aligns with other financial goals, such as saving for retirement or paying off debt.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“Ask yourself if it's worth it to refinance. When interest rates drop a quarter- or half-point, borrowers rush to refinance. It sounds like a great opportunity, but they forget about closing costs,” Damsky says. “You want to minimize the number of times you refinance because closing costs are expensive.”</p><h2>How to get the best rates when refinancing</h2><p>Getting the best refinance rates requires planning and strategy. Lenders often reserve their best rates for homeowners with excellent credit who meet the highest underwriting requirements. A good FICO score is between 670 and 739, while an exceptional score is above 800. Even if that's not you, there are steps you can take now to improve your odds of approval and securing a low rate.&nbsp;<br><br>“Compare lenders. Shop your loan with a mortgage broker that looks across many different lenders,” Damsky advises. “This ensures you're getting competitive terms. Improve your credit score by paying off other debts, paying your bills on time, and reducing the number of hard credit inquiries, such as applying for other debts, such as credit cards.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:226242":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"226242","content":"<p>Paying a personal loan off early could mean less money spent on interest.

Consider this example:</p><p>According to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Credible loan rates data</a>, the average interest rate on a 5-year loan for someone with a 700 FICO score was around 24% in October 2023. For a <a href=\"/personal-loan/10k-loan\">$10,000 loan</a>, based on that rate, you’d pay $7,261 in interest over the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">loan’s term</a>. However, if instead of paying for the whole five years, you paid the loan off after two, you’d save $3,024.</p><p>If you paid it off after three years, or two years early, you’d save $1,463.</p><p>The higher the rate is on your loan, the more you can save by paying it off early.</p><h2>Prepayment penalty on a personal loan</h2><p>A prepayment penalty is a fee a financial institution may impose if you pay off your personal loan early. The bank’s rationale is that you’re depriving it of income in the form of interest payments, so it reserves the right to penalize you to offset that loss. Fortunately, this practice isn’t common, and none of the <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan lenders</a> we review charge borrowers for getting out of debt too quickly.</p><p>However, you should review the fine print of any loan you already have or plan to get to see if it includes a prepayment penalty. If it does, you could see the fee in one of three ways, said Howard Dvorkin, chairman of Debt.com.</p><p>“First, [the lender] can charge you a percentage of your loan balance. That's usually around 2%,” he said. “Second, they can charge you a flat fee. Or third — and worst of all — they can actually charge you all the interest you're saving by paying early.”</p><h2>How to pay off a personal loan early</h2><p>You could pay your personal loan off early if you experience a windfall or otherwise have a large lump sum sitting in the bank. However, Dvorkin said, “You don't have to think so big. You can also pay off your loan early by nibbling away at it every month.”</p><p>Here are some strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Add extra funds to each payment:</strong> Even $10-$20 more per month can reduce your principal balance faster.</li><li><strong>Make payments biweekly:</strong> When you make payments every two weeks, you’ll submit an extra month’s worth by year-end.</li><li><strong>Make additional payments annually or when possible:</strong> For example, use some or all of a work bonus or monetary gift to pay down your debt.</li><li><strong>Increase your income:</strong> Then, put extra money toward your personal loan.</li></ul><h2>Refinance your personal loan</h2><p>When you refinance your personal loan, you take out a new loan to <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/pay-off-debt\">pay off your existing debt</a>. Generally, it may make sense to refinance if <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">interest rates</a> have dropped, or you’d qualify for a lower interest rate because your credit score has increased since you initially borrowed.</p><p>You can refinance a personal loan with another personal loan, or you could use another debt instrument, like a 0% APR credit card balance transfer. In the former scenario, watch out for <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> — even if the interest rate is lower than what you currently pay, an origination fee could make the transaction more expensive. Instead of comparing interest rates, look at the loan’s annual percentage rate (APR) to get a truer measure of cost.</p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% APR credit card</a> could make sense if you pay off the balance transferred within the promotional period. If not, you could end up paying a higher interest rate than you would have originally.

Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees. Additionally, some apps let you extend your repayment date if you can't pay your advance by its due date.</li><li><strong>No credit checks:</strong> You usually <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don't have to pass a credit check</a> to get cash from a money-borrowing app. As a result, it may be easier for some applicants to qualify compared to getting a credit card or personal loan.</li><li><strong>Some apps may be more affordable than payday loans:</strong> Cash apps can be better than payday loans when it comes to cost, but not always. To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible. The Center for Responsible Lending found that APRs for cash advance apps were nearly as high as payday loans — 367% for an advance repaid in 7 to 14 days.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319310":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319310","content":"<h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Subscription costs:</strong> Several leading cash advance apps charge a monthly membership fee to use their services. If you only take out one or two advances per month, these fees may not be worth it.</li><li><strong>Fees for same-day advances to external accounts:</strong> Cash advance apps typically charge a fee to send your advance instantly to an external account. If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive. For example, a 30-day $500 cash advance from an app that charges a $15 monthly fee plus a $5 fast cash fee is essentially charging you a 49% <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a> to borrow the money. Most personal loan interest rates top out at 36% APR (even if you have bad credit).</li><li><strong>May be as expensive as a payday loan:</strong> Depending on the app you choose and whether you expedite the money, you could end up paying as much as you would for a payday loan in some states.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Current Personal Loan Interest Rates</a></p><h2>How to get funding through a cash advance app</h2><p>Once you've downloaded the app and created an account, you'll typically follow these steps to get an advance:</p><ol><li>Request a dollar amount through the app.</li><li>Receive an approval or denial.</li><li>Receive funding — either instantly (often for an extra fee) or within one to five days for free, depending on the app.</li><li>Pay back the loan with your next scheduled paycheck, direct deposit, via <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installments</a>, or before a certain deadline. How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility.

The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

Common loan types for remodeling your kitchen include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, a credit card, or a cash-out refinance.</p><p>Even with financing costs, such as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/origination-fees\">origination fee</a> and monthly interest, a kitchen remodel loan can be advantageous. A kitchen remodel can boost your home’s value significantly, depending on the scale of the project, and could help you sell your home faster and for more money.</p><p>“Kitchens have one of the strongest emotional impacts on buyers, but you don’t need a full renovation to see value,” says Diane Romelli, a Cincinnati-based Realtor with Sibcy Cline. “Small updates can carry impressive ROI. A kitchen that feels bright, clean, and thoughtfully updated can compete with fully renovated ones. The key is avoiding over-customization and focusing on improvements that help buyers imagine themselves living there.”</p><h2>Types of loans for kitchen remodels</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312370":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312370","content":"<h3>Personal loan</h3><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">use a personal loan</a> for almost anything, including financing home renovations and even paying off debt you’ve already acquired for prior or ongoing renovations. Personal loans are typically unsecured, making them especially attractive if you don’t have or want to tap your home equity. Here are a few other reasons we like personal loans for kitchen renovations:</p><ul><li><strong>Lower rates than credit cards:</strong>&nbsp;The other unsecured go-to loan option is a credit card, especially if you already have one or more. But unless you qualify for a 0% APR promotion, credit card interest rates tend to be much higher than personal loan rates and available loan amounts smaller — making them a poor choice by comparison.</li><li><strong>Fixed interest rates:</strong> Unlike a HELOC or credit card, the interest rate and monthly payment are fixed (they won’t change) for the duration of the repayment term.</li><li><strong>Lump sum distribution:</strong> Once you’re approved, you’ll receive a lump sum deposited directly into your bank account to spend as needed on labor and materials.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You can get money fast:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re ready to start your project ASAP, you can find personal loans with same-day or next-day funding. Here are some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">best same-day loans</a> for kitchen remodels.</li><li><strong>They’re easier to qualify for:</strong>&nbsp;Borrowers with good to excellent credit can typically qualify for most personal loans. But you could even qualify for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\">personal loan with fair credit</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your house isn’t collateral:</strong>&nbsp;HELOCs and home equity loans require your home to serve as collateral, which can be dangerous if you default on the loan. Most personal loans, on the other hand, are unsecured, meaning you don’t have to offer collateral. In exchange, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">personal loan interest rates</a> tend to be higher.</li><li><strong>Wide range of loan amounts:</strong>&nbsp;Available loan amounts vary by lender, but in general, you can borrow between $2,000 to over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a> with a personal loan — especially if you’ll use the loan for home improvement (a.k.a., a kitchen remodel).</li><li><strong>Repayment terms are short:</strong>&nbsp;A personal loan isn’t a long-term commitment, relatively speaking. Most personal loans have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> up to 7 years, though some offer 10-year terms or longer. You could pay off your new kitchen years sooner than with a home equity loan or HELOC, which could also save you money.</li><li><strong>No prepayment penalties:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> typically don't charge prepayment penalties. That means you can pay off your personal loan early to save money on interest.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While personal loans have a lot going for them, if you’re covering a large kitchen remodel and have substantial equity, a tax-deductible home equity loan, HELOC, or cash-out refinance could provide a much larger loan amount at a lower interest rate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> lets you borrow against the equity you’ve built in your home. Much like personal loans, you can use home equity loans for a wide range of purposes, but home renovations, including kitchen remodels, are among the most common.</p><p>Also like personal loans, home equity loans involve a lump-sum loan amount at the start of the loan, and you’ll make payments in installments over a set number of years (often between five and 30 years).</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312374":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312374","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/home-equity-loan-heloc-requirements\">Home equity loan requirements</a> are stricter than some personal loans, and they also take longer to fund — sometimes a month or more. If you are itching to start renovations or are on a timeline to list your home, a personal loan might be the better option.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">Personal loans vs. home equity loans</a></p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC) is another way to tap into the equity you’ve built in your home in order to fund your kitchen remodel, usually at a lower interest rate than a personal loan. The key difference between a home equity loan and HELOC is that a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.</p><p>During a HELOC’s draw period (often five to 10 years), you can borrow money as needed, up to your limit. This gives you more flexibility to remodel your kitchen in stages, or even to tackle your kitchen first but also take on other renovation projects in the coming years. You’ll then make payments toward the principal balance during the repayment period (often up to 20 years), though interest-only payments begin during the draw period.</p><p>Another key distinction between home equity loans and HELOCs is how the interest works. Most home equity loans have fixed rates, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/heloc-variable-rate-history\">HELOC interest rates</a> are typically variable; this can make monthly payments more challenging to predict.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">Personal loan vs. HELOC</a></p><h3>Credit card</h3><p>High-interest credit cards shouldn’t be your first choice to fund a home renovation as expensive as a kitchen remodel, but don’t rule them out. If you qualify for a credit card that has a special 0% introductory rate for a set number of months, you could theoretically pay with plastic and then pay off your loan before the 0% intro rate expires.</p><p>A few caveats:</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong>&nbsp;Special 0% APR financing usually lasts no more than 12 to 18 months. Paying off an entire kitchen remodel in that time period can be challenging. If you don’t, the regular APR will kick in, and it could be high. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve</a>, the average APR for a credit card is more than 21%.</li><li><strong>Contractor acceptance:</strong>&nbsp;You may not be able to pay your contractor with a credit card. Ask your contractor if they accept credit card payments before signing an agreement; if they don’t, see if you can at least buy the materials on your own with a credit card.</li><li><strong>Qualifying:</strong>&nbsp;Credit cards, especially those with attractive promos, can be challenging to qualify for if you don’t have great credit.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312378":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312378","content":"<p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">Personal loan vs. 0% APR credit card</a></p><h3>Cash-out refinance</h3><p>Another way to leverage the equity in your home is to do a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a>. Instead of taking out a second mortgage (like a home equity loan), you refinance your mortgage for a higher amount than what you owe and pocket the extra cash. You can then use that extra money for whatever you want, like remodeling your kitchen. You can generally refinance up to 85-90% of the value of your home.</p><p>Keep in mind: This means you’re essentially starting over with a new mortgage, with new terms and a new interest rate. A cash-out refinance generally doesn’t make sense unless you can lock in a lower&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">mortgage rate</a> than what you started with.</p><p>That said, a cash-out refinance is a way to borrow money from your home&nbsp;without taking out a second loan, as you would with a home equity loan or HELOC.</p><h2>When to consider a kitchen remodel loan (and when to avoid it)</h2><p>A kitchen remodel loan can be your ticket to new cabinets, counters, flooring, lighting, and appliances, but it also makes the renovations more expensive after you account for fees and interest. So how do you know if you should take out a loan to remodel your kitchen?</p><h3>When to consider</h3><p>A kitchen remodel loan makes sense if:</p><ul><li><strong>You plan to sell your home soon:</strong>&nbsp;A kitchen remodel can be a great investment for sellers. Depending on the type of renovations, you could recoup as much as 113% of your costs when you sell your home. And if your current kitchen is outdated or not functional, a remodel could make a difference between selling your home the day you list it and letting it sit on the market for months and months. When you sell your home for a profit, use the proceeds to pay off the kitchen remodel loan before spending the money elsewhere.</li><li><strong>You have excellent credit:</strong>&nbsp;Borrowers with great or excellent credit will qualify for the lowest fees and interest rates on personal loans, home equity loans, and HELOCs. That makes borrowing to finance a kitchen remodel a little less expensive and easier to repay.</li><li><strong>You have a 0% APR rewards credit card:</strong>&nbsp;If you plan to DIY a kitchen remodel and can qualify for a credit card with temporary special financing, you might be able to pay for the whole renovation without spending a cent on interest — as long as you pay off the card before the special financing ends. Even better, if it’s a cash-back credit card, you may actually&nbsp;earn a little cash by paying with credit instead of another type of loan.</li><li><strong>You have cash on hand:</strong>&nbsp;It may seem counterintuitive to take out a loan when you have a hefty savings account. But keeping cash on hand in an emergency fund, for example, can prevent you from needing a loan out of desperation if the unexpected occurs. This is especially true if you can qualify for a very low interest rate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You itemize deductions on your taxes:</strong>&nbsp;One perk of using a home-equity based financing option is that you can generally deduct the interest on your tax return —&nbsp;as long as you itemize. This, in turn, can reduce your effective interest rate on the loan by reducing your taxes.</li></ul><h3>When to avoid</h3><p>Although kitchen remodels offer a great return on investment, it doesn’t always make sense to get one to pay for a kitchen remodel. Here’s when to avoid a kitchen remodel loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Your budget is tight:</strong>&nbsp;If you already live paycheck to paycheck (or close to it), adding another loan payment to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">monthly budget</a> might be impractical, at best. This is especially dangerous if you’re using your home as collateral for the loan.</li><li><strong>You don’t have an emergency fund:</strong>&nbsp;As a homeowner, it’s crucial to build an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency fund</a> to pay for unexpected home repairs or cover your mortgage payments if you ever lose your job. Focus on establishing and growing your emergency fund before taking on debt for home renovation projects.</li><li><strong>The renovations don’t have a high ROI:</strong>&nbsp;Not every kitchen remodeling project has the same return on investment. If you’re focused on a high-value project, like replacing cabinets or increasing countertop space, it may be worth the effort, but changes that offer less ROI, such as choosing expensive countertop materials or luxury appliances, may not be worth going into debt for.</li></ul><h2>How much do kitchen remodels cost?</h2><p>On average, a kitchen remodel costs between $14,600 and $41,500, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.angi.com/articles/how-much-should-kitchen-remodel-cost.htm\">Angi</a> (formerly Angie’s List), a home services platform with extensive cost guides for home renovations. On the low end, a remodel might cost as little as $10,000, but for major, high-end remodels, you might spend $130,000 or more. These costs depend on several factors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>The extent of the remodel:</strong>&nbsp;Small projects, like installing a backsplash or replacing the oven, are much more affordable than complete remodels that include new cabinets, countertops, appliances, flooring, plumbing, and light fixtures.</li><li><strong>Who does the work:</strong>&nbsp;Homeowners with the tools, time, and patience can save a lot of money doing some or all of the work themselves. According to Angi, professional labor often accounts for 25% of the overall kitchen remodeling cost.</li><li><strong>Quality of the materials:</strong>&nbsp;You can spring for luxurious materials, from high-end cabinetry and marble countertops to hardwood flooring and state-of-the-art appliances, but this will drive your costs up significantly.</li><li><strong>Where you live:</strong>&nbsp;Your city’s cost of living has a real impact on both material and labor costs.</li><li><strong>Financing costs:</strong>&nbsp;As we’ve seen, kitchen remodel loans aren’t free. You’ll need to budget for any fees and interest for financing.</li></ul><h3>How to save money on a kitchen remodel</h3><p>There are several ways to save money on kitchen remodels, from rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself to setting your sights on only a few key updates.</p><p>“Choose your materials carefully,” advises Angie Hicks, co-founder and chief customer officer of Angi. “While you can’t do much to sway the cost of labor in your area, you can choose materials that are more affordable, or at least more buyer-friendly. If you’re planning on selling your house soon, be sure to choose materials that are neutral and that buyers would find desirable.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312382":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312382","content":"<p>“Start with updating — repainting or refinishing — cabinets and updating hardware,” Romelli adds. “You certainly don’t always need a full renovation. A kitchen that feels intentional, functional, and, most importantly, well cared for can really make an emotional impact on buyers.”</p><p>Romelli also warns of a common mistake: doing a rush job thinking that any update, no matter the quality, is a good thing.</p><p>“The biggest mistake is doing quick, cheap fixes, like low-quality laminate counters, mismatched appliances, or rushed paint jobs,” she says. “I would rather see less done by a seller at a lower home price point that would allow a buyer to have the budget to make their own personal choices.”</p><h2>ROI of common kitchen improvements</h2><p>On the whole, kitchen remodels have a sizable return on investment. If you’re looking to put money into your home before listing — and you’ve already taken care of big things that won’t pass inspection, like an old and leaking roof — prioritize your kitchen. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jlconline.com/cost-vs-value/2024/\">Journal of Light Construction</a>:</p><ul><li>Minor, midrange kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>113%</strong>.</li><li>Major, midrange kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>51%</strong>.</li><li>Major, upscale kitchen remodels have an ROI of&nbsp;<strong>36%</strong>.</li></ul><p>This data shows that tackling smaller projects to make your kitchen warmer and more functional, without going all-out on high-end upgrades, typically yields the highest return on investment. This tracks with Romelli’s client experiences.</p><p>“I’ve had clients make very modest updates that created a dramatic shift in buyer interest,” Romelli explains. “A seller with an older home already had&nbsp;very clean and well-maintained appliances, but he had his cabinets re-stained, updated the hardware, and added a little bit of new lighting and replaced the outlet covers. The changes weren’t expensive, but they were totally striking!”</p><p>She adds, “Another seller simply deep-cleaned the space, decluttered, and replaced the faucet. The seller opted to have a few rooms staged, including the kitchen, and buyers commented that the home felt cared for.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312386":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312386","content":"<p>The table below breaks down the return on investment of various kitchen remodel projects.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312390":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312390","content":"<h2>Other ways to fund a kitchen remodel</h2><p>Taking out a kitchen remodel loan won’t work for everybody. If taking out a personal loan or borrowing against your equity isn’t a good path for you, here are other options to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Savings account:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re a savvy saver, this could be a great, interest-free way to pay for a kitchen remodel. Focus on saving for several months, until you have enough cash to cover the cost of the kitchen remodel. That said, don’t drain your emergency savings to pay for home renovations; that money is for real emergencies.</li><li><strong>Securities-based line of credit or 401(k) loan:</strong>&nbsp;If you’ve got a lot of money locked up in investments, such as stocks, you might be able to borrow against your portfolio with a securities-based line of credit. This lets you keep your money invested but still pay for your new kitchen. Similarly, you can borrow against your retirement savings with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/401k-loan\">401(k) loan</a>. Talk with a financial advisor before making either decision.</li><li><strong>Contractor financing:</strong>&nbsp;Some general contractors may offer in-house financing for big kitchen remodels. It’s worth exploring, but you should always compare their rates and terms against other types of financing, like personal loans, to see where you can get a better deal.</li><li><strong>DIY in stages:</strong>&nbsp;If you are in no rush and handy around the house, you can tackle the projects on your own (or with some friends) as you have the time and money. Just keep in mind: Poor craftsmanship can ultimately hurt you when you sell your house, so make sure you can do a good job before committing to a DIY approach.</li></ul><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best kitchen remodel loans.

Personal loans, along with credit cards and in-house financing through your vet or animal hospital, are common ways to afford care.&nbsp;</p><p>Personal loans, however, often have lower rates than credit cards and are a more affordable way to borrow — especially if you need to finance large pet expenses (like chemotherapy or major surgery) or need an upfront cash sum.</p><h2>Pet loan options</h2><p>You’ve got choices when it comes to financing your pet’s high medical costs. Below, we’ll explore the general types of pet loans and how they work.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:311486":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"311486","content":"<p>Here’s a closer look at these pet loan options:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal loans:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> are a way to get fast funding for pet care; many lenders offer same- or next-day funding. You’ll get a lump sum of money upfront to pay vet bills, then make monthly payments over several years until you’ve paid it back. You can even use a personal loan to consolidate existing vet bills. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">average personal loan interest rate</a> is around 13% for 3-year loans or 19% for 5-year loans.</li><li><strong>In-house financing:</strong>&nbsp;Your veterinarian’s office may have its own financing for pet owners with large bills. Rather than repaying a loan, you can repay your vet over time, sometimes at a 0% APR. You may need to make a down payment before the office will approve your payment plan.</li><li><strong>CareCredit:</strong>&nbsp;Many veterinarians accept CareCredit, a health and wellness credit card, as a form of financing. CareCredit may offer flexible, promotional financing options, like 24 months of interest-free payments. Be careful, though: CareCredit offers deferred financing, which means if you don’t pay off the balance in full before the promotional APR expires, you’ll owe interest on the full original balance from the purchase date.</li><li><strong>0% APR credit card:</strong>&nbsp;You can also use a credit card other than CareCredit to pay for pet expenses. While credit cards can have high interest rates, some have promotional periods with 0% APR or low rates, usually for 12 to 18 months. This can be a good way to finance your pet’s care while keeping interest to a minimum, but it’s best to pay off your balance before the promo period ends and the card’s regular APR goes into effect.</li><li><strong>Family and friends loan:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re comfortable asking a loved one to borrow money, you may find that a friend or family member is willing to help you pay for your pet’s vet bill, especially if that loved one adores your pet. Just make sure to set up clear repayment terms and stick to them to preserve your relationship.</li><li><strong>Line of credit:</strong> A line of credit through your credit union or bank is often a lower-rate credit card alternative, best for ongoing expenses. You may have access to a higher credit limit relative to a credit card. However, you may also be charged each time you use the line.</li><li><strong>Home equity financing:</strong> This is a much less common way of financing vet bills, and generally only best for very expensive lifesaving procedures or treatments. You’ll need to have sufficient home equity (typically at least 15%) to qualify and your house is used as collateral to secure the loan — which means if you default, you could face foreclosure.</li></ul><h2>When to get a pet loan</h2><p>While you should be intentional about when you take on new credit, the easy answer to “when to get a pet loan” is simply when you have pet expenses you can’t afford. After all, a pet is part of the family; pet loans ensure they get the care they need.</p><p>Here are a few common expenses you may need to borrow for — these are covered in more detail at the end of this article:</p><ul><li><strong>New pet expenses:</strong>&nbsp;The cost of adoption fees, spaying or neutering, microchipping, and initial pet supplies can stack up quickly. A pet loan lets you spread these costs over several months instead of paying for them at once or charging a high-interest credit card.</li><li><strong>Preventative care:</strong> Preventative procedures, like dental cleanings and bloodwork, can be expensive but may be necessary to maintain your pet’s health. If cash is tight, a pet loan could help you avoid delaying essential care that could lead to bigger problems later.</li><li><strong>Chronic illness:</strong> Chronic conditions, like diabetes or arthritis, may have high initial costs to diagnose and treat, plus ongoing costs for medications. You might use a pet loan to roll those costs into a predictable monthly payment to keep treatment on track.</li><li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> An illness or injury that requires an emergency vet visit can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars, especially if your pet requires surgery or hospitalization. Quick financing lets you start treatment immediately.</li><li><strong>Training costs:</strong>&nbsp;Enrolling your dog in a structured training program isn’t cheap. Basic obedience training for dogs can cost $150 or more per private session, on average. Board-and-train sessions usually require an upfront payment of $2,000 or more for two weeks of training.</li><li><strong>Therapy or service animals:</strong> Breeding, specialized training, and handler instruction for therapy or service dogs can cost as much as $50,000. When grants or nonprofit aid aren’t available, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/service-dog-loans\">service dog loan</a> could be the next best option.</li><li><strong>Boarding or pet sitting:</strong>&nbsp;Vacations are a lot of fun, but we can’t always bring our dogs and cats with us. If you’ve got to pay for a pet sitter or boarding but don’t have enough funds in your travel budget, you can take out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-vacation-loans\">vacation loan</a> that pays for various travel expenses, including pet care.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:311490":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"311490","content":"<h2>How to compare pet loans</h2><p>When comparing the&nbsp;best loans to cover pet expenses, consider the following.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:311494":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"311494","content":"<h3>1.

Morgan, attorney and owner of Ashley F. Morgan Law, PC, a law office focused on bankruptcy and debt management solutions. “It is a three- to four-month process that wipes away as much debt as possible.”</p><p>To qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your income needs to be below a certain threshold. (If it’s not less than your state’s median income, you’ll need to pass a means test.) After you file, a court-appointed trustee reviews your filing and holds a meeting to verify your information and move the case forward. The trustee also sells any non-exempt property, like a vacation home or extra vehicle, to pay off debts, while the remaining (exempt) debts get discharged — which means you won’t be responsible for repayment. Note that some debts, like alimony and child support, are not dischargeable through bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy generally stays on your credit report for 10 years after filing.</p><h3>Chapter 13</h3><p>With Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you can protect your assets while entering a repayment plan to pay off your debts — typically over three to five years. To qualify, your unsecured debts must be less than $526,700, and secured debts must be less than $1,580,125 as of the filing date. After completing the payment plan and a financial management course, the court may discharge your remaining outstanding debts.</p><p>Morgan adds that selling assets after filing Chapter 13 may require court approval. You also may need trustee approval before taking on new debt throughout the process. After filing, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy remains on your credit report for seven years.</p><h3>Pros and cons of bankruptcy</h3>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294338","content":"<h2>Similarities and differences</h2><p>Here's how debt consolidation and bankruptcy stack up:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294342":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294342","content":"<h2>Impact on credit</h2><p>Debt consolidation loans and bankruptcy can affect your credit score, but in different ways.</p><h3>Debt consolidation</h3><p>When you apply for a debt consolidation loan, the lender usually conducts a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard credit check</a>, which can cause your score to dip by a few points. The drop can impact your score for up to a year, though a hard inquiry appears on your report for two years. The biggest impact on your score happens once you get the loan.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re using an installment loan, like a personal loan, to pay off credit card debt, you could see your score rise quickly and significantly. This is because you’d reduce your credit utilization once the cards are paid off, and credit utilization contributes up to 30% to your FICO score. If you make payments on time each month, you should see your credit score further improve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>But your other spending habits matter, too. Howard Dvorkin, a CPA, debt solutions author, and the founder and chairman of Debt.com, warns against being frivolous with spending after consolidating, especially with credit cards. “If you’ve successfully emerged from debt consolidation, you don’t want to undo everything you just accomplished,” says Dvorkin. “Never use a credit card to spend money you don’t have. Consider your plastic as a cash replacement, not a floating loan.” Otherwise, you might end up in another debt cycle.</p><h3>Bankruptcy</h3><p>With bankruptcy, “The credit score hit is relative,” says Morgan. “If you have perfect credit, you see a drop. But if you are already 90 to 180 days behind on debt payments, you likely will see an improvement on your credit.”</p><p>However, bankruptcy remains on your credit report for up to 10 years, and can affect your ability to qualify for new loans, a mortgage, a place to rent, and even a job — especially for the first few years. Potential creditors, landlords, and employers will typically see a bankruptcy as a black mark on your credit, even if your actual score has improved post-filing.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:294346":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"294346","content":"<h2>Which is the better choice?</h2><p>Which option is best for your current situation? Consider these scenarios when debt consolidation might make more sense than bankruptcy, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><h3>When debt consolidation make more sense</h3><p>A debt consolidation loan may be the best option when you:</p><ul><li><strong>Can afford a lower monthly payment:</strong> If you have income to put toward debt payments, but your current payments are too high, you could potentially lower them with a long-term debt consolidation loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Still have good credit:</strong> If your credit hasn’t suffered from one or more past-due accounts, you could potentially qualify for a lower rate than what you’re paying now (especially if you have credit card debt), thereby saving money and lowering monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Want to improve your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;By consolidating credit card debt with an installment loan, you could see credit score gains within one month. While lowering your monthly payment so it’s more affordable could help you avoid late payments, which could also improve your score.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Have an emergency situation or expense:</strong> “If you got into debt because of an accident, illness, or natural disaster, a debt consolidation loan can bridge the gap until you get back on your feet,” says Dvorkin.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Scenarios when bankruptcy makes more sense</h3><p>Bankruptcy is often a last-resort decision once debt collection activity has started. Consider it when:</p><ul><li><strong>Other debt payment strategies haven't worked:</strong> “If someone has been trying to pay down debt and has seen no progress for a year, then bankruptcy may make sense,” says Morgan. This is especially true if a person doesn't predict any increases to their income in the foreseeable future, which could make it easier to pay off debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A financial reset could get you back on track:</strong> If a long jobless spell, medical issues, or other situation has led to overwhelming, runaway debt, a clean slate could allow you to rebuild your savings and credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You have bad credit and low income:</strong> If your credit score has already suffered and you don’t expect your income to change, a bankruptcy could provide needed relief and might actually help you improve your credit going forward.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You’re nearing retirement with little saved:</strong> When consulting older clients, Morgan also weighs retirement savings. “If you are 50 years old with limited money saved for retirement, any disposable income likely should go toward saving for retirement and not paying down debt,” she says. In this case, a timely filing could halt collections and free up cash so older borrowers can redirect income to their retirement accounts.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Alternative funding options to consider</h2><p>Debt consolidation and bankruptcy aren’t your only options. You might also try:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit counseling:</strong> Nonprofit credit counselors work with you and your financial situation to map a plan for paying off your debt, like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a>. If you opt into a debt management plan, a credit counselor can negotiate your debts on your behalf, roll your debts into a single payment, and potentially lower your interest rates. The U.S. Trustee program lists&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111\">government-approved credit counseling agencies</a>.</li><li><strong>Strategic debt payments:</strong> DIY your debt with a clear payment strategy.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-snowball-method\">Debt snowball</a> is a popular method where you make minimum payments on all debts each month and put any extra cash toward the smallest debts to wipe them away first for quick wins. With the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/debt-avalanche-method\">debt avalanche method</a>, you target the highest-interest debt first to speed debt payoff and save money on interest.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Balance transfer credit card:</strong> Move your debt to a new credit card, preferably with a 0% introductory APR, to help you pay off debt interest-free or with a lower rate than you currently have. Some cards offer 0% APR for up to 21 months, after which your balance will be subject to the regular APR. This method works best when you're confident you can pay off the balance within the introductory period. Keep in mind that card issuers usually charge a fee of 3% to 5% of the transferred amount.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Creditor negotiations:</strong> Contact your creditors to negotiate a lower interest rate or a reduced balance. They aren't required to oblige, but some creditors may be willing to work with you if you have a concrete proposal, such as agreeing to automatic payments or making a lump sum payment — especially if you’re already late on payments.</li><li><strong>Home equity funding:</strong> Borrow against the equity in your home to potentially save on interest with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit</a>. If you have lots of equity in your home, you could access high borrowing limits, which could be helpful if you have excessive debt to consolidate. However, both are tied to your home, which you could risk losing if you can't afford payments.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:310422":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"310422","content":"<ul><li>25 basis points, 0.25%, rate cut</li><li>Federal funds target range: 3.50% - 3.75%</li><li>Three dissents</li><li>One 25 basis point cut projected in 2026</li></ul><p>The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by another 25 basis points on Wednesday, in spite of three dissents.

But it’s not that simple. The Fed considers a slew of factors, the most significant are typically:</p><ul><li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Whether core inflation is moving toward or away from the Fed’s 2% target.</li><li><strong>Labor market strength, weakness, and resiliency</strong>: Employment levels, wage growth, and signs of cooling or overheating are taken into account.</li><li><strong>Economic growth</strong>: GDP, consumer spending, and business investment that signal momentum or an economic slowdown.</li><li><strong>Financial and global risks</strong>: Market stability, tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and credit conditions that could threaten the economic outlook.</li></ul><h2>Fed rate cuts: benefits and risks</h2><h3>Benefits</h3><p>Lower interest rates generally spur borrowing activity. A robust credit market not only makes it easier for you to refinance your mortgage, buy a new home, or borrow money in general, but it also makes it easier for businesses to expand and invest. In turn, businesses have lower borrowing costs, which can free up funds to hire additional employees. In other words, lower interest rates can reduce unemployment and potentially increase salaries — all seemingly good things and why the Fed chose to cut rates this month.</p><h3>Risks</h3><p>As a result of more people having more disposable income, the cost of goods can also increase, a.k.a. inflation. When inflation rises, it makes it harder to afford basic necessities, like food or a roof over your head — especially if the cost of necessities rises faster than your salary.</p><p>The current housing affordability crisis is one example of this. Record-low mortgage rates during the pandemic (low borrowing costs, see above) plus a work-from-home revolution contributed to one of the fastest-growing housing markets ever. The index for shelter inflation increased from under 2.5% to over 7.5% between March 2021 and March 2023. It’s currently at 3.6%, based on the most recently available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

They were all <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>, so I had no interest subsidies on the money that I owed. I had consolidated my loans from my years in school, and my rate was fixed at 6.80%.</p><p>I had excellent credit when I refinanced, so I could qualify for a refinance loan at a 3.25% rate. This was obviously a huge drop in the rate I was paying, since I was able to cut my interest costs in half.</p><p>“Refinancing federal loans can make sense if there is a large enough discrepancy between the federal loan rate and the private loan rate,” explains Clifford C. Cornell, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and associate financial adviser and Bone Fide Wealth, LLC.</p><p>That was certainly the case in my situation, and since I owed a lot of money, the interest savings were worth hundreds of dollars.</p><h3>Refinancing brought me many benefits beyond just a lower rate</h3><p>The interest rate change alone was a great reason for me to refinance. But there were other benefits as well. Specifically, I was able to include some private student loans in my refinance loan as well. Because of this, refinancing:</p><ul><li>Significantly lowered the interest rate that I was paying on all of my student loan debt</li><li>Enabled me to make just one monthly payment instead of multiple payments to different lenders</li><li>Allowed me to sever ties with my federal student loan servicer, which I didn't think provided me with very good customer service</li></ul><p>My monthly payment also ended up being lower as a result of my low rate and the fact that I was paying just one lender. While this wasn't a huge concern for me because I intended to pay more than the minimum each month to fully repay my debt faster, the lower payment did provide more flexibility in my monthly budget since I didn't have to pay extra if I didn't want to.</p><h2>The downsides of refinancing weren't a big deal to me</h2><p>There were obvious upsides to refinancing in my case. However, despite these benefits, there are circumstances where refinancing would not have made sense.</p><p>“You must look at the potential savings versus the potential loss of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">benefits that a federal student loan has</a>,” advises Domenick D'andrea, a financial adviser and founder of DanDarah Wealth Management. “If you think that you may qualify for loan forgiveness, this could outweigh interest savings, and it would make sense to keep your loans as is.”</p><p>Cornell also warns that you lose access to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">income-driven repayment</a> plans when you switch from a federal student loan to a private refinance loan.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">Loan forgiveness</a> is almost never an option with private student loan lenders, nor is making payments based on income.</p><p>With federal loans, however, forgiveness can be an option after a certain number of payments on an income-driven plan or after you make a certain number of payments while performing public service work. It's just one of several benefits federal student loans offer that private loans don't.</p><p>Federal loans also offer more flexibility in changing payment plans, generous deferment and forbearance options, and subsidized interest for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">Direct Subsidized Loans</a> during deferment periods.</p><p>Giving up these benefits can be a big deal — but it wasn't for me.</p><h3>Why refinancing federal student loans had no disadvantages for me</h3><p>On paper, it appeared I was giving up a lot of benefits by refinancing, but in reality, I wasn't giving up any.</p><p>I had a very stable job running my own business, and I knew I would never give up that job to do public service work, which would qualify me for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a>. The combined household income my husband and I earned also meant that we were very unlikely to ever take advantage of an income-driven plan. Since we were both self-employed with multiple income streams, it also seemed unlikely that deferment or forbearance would ever be needed.</p><p>The only real way we'd ever not pay off my student loans in full would be in the event of a major disability that impacted my work abilities — and the private student loan I refinanced into offered disability discharge.</p><p>Since there was no chance I'd take advantage of the unique benefits federal loans provided, I did not lose anything by refinancing. I gained the ability to reduce my rate and payments, so more of my money went toward reducing the balance. I also had more budget flexibility — and I lost nothing at all.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:7082":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"7082","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:223354":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"223354","content":"<h2>Is refinancing federal student loans right for you?</h2><p>As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn't refinance federal student loans into private ones if there is any chance you will take advantage of:</p><ul><li>Loan forgiveness</li><li>Income-driven plans</li><li>Generous forbearance and deferment options</li><li>Broad government forgiveness of student loans that future administrations could make possible</li></ul><p>However, if you're confident in your continued earning power and don't think you'd ever qualify for forgiveness, refinancing could make sense if you can significantly reduce your interest rate.

Beyond federal aid, many schools use this information to determine your eligibility for school and state aid opportunities.</p><p>Even if you aren't sure what you'll qualify for, filling out the FAFSA and submitting it on time can help you tap into all the funding you need to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-compound-interest\">pay for school</a>.</p><h3>Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>“One of the most impactful strategies is to start planning early, apply for every <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarship</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grant</a> you're eligible for, since that's essentially 'free money' you won't need to repay,” says Dr. Shaan Patel, founder of Prep Expert.</p><p>Applying for as many scholarships and grants as possible can help you cover college costs without taking on too many <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">student loans</a>.</p><h3>Consider working part-time while in school</h3><p>“If you're willing to go the extra mile, side hustles or part-time jobs off campus can help cover day-to-day expenses, reducing the need to borrow,” says Patel.</p><p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">working while in school</a> adds more to your plate. But if you can confidently manage your course load and a job, that can help you stay afloat financially.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15070":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15070","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:306574":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"306574","content":"<h2>Tips for budgeting for college</h2><p>Sticking to a budget in college can help you avoid overpaying for your education. Use the tips below to help build out a college budget:</p><h3>Estimate the total cost of attendance (COA)</h3><p>While it's tempting to assume that college costs start and end with tuition, in reality, you'll face other expenses when getting through school. Start by estimating the total cost of attendance, which goes beyond tuition to include fees, books, materials, housing, food, transportation, and more.</p><p>Many schools post an estimated cost of attendance through their financial aid office. Consider using their estimates as a starting point for your own costs. But don't be afraid to cut out costs or add other line items based on your situation.</p><h3>Create a budget to manage living expenses</h3><p>With an idea of what costs you'll be facing, set up a budget to help you avoid overspending.</p><p>“The key is to list out all possible expenses, from tuition and books to meal plans and personal spending,” says Patel.</p><p>“Then, compare those expenses to your income sources, such as financial aid, earnings from a job, or support from family. Make sure to track your spending closely. An app or spreadsheet can help, so you don't overshoot,” adds Patel.</p><p>Smart budgeting for college should also include a buffer for unforeseen expenses, such as a broken laptop or an unexpected class fee, to prevent any surprises, Patel says.</p><h3>Cut back on extra expenses</h3><p>As you build your budget, look for places to cut back on extra purchases.</p><p>“Always cut ghost expenses,” says Reyna Gobel, author of CliffsNotes' “Graduation Debt: How to Manage Student Loans and Live Your Life.”</p><p>A ghost expense, Gobel explains, “is one you won't miss if you stop spending it. For instance, overpaying on a cell phone bill because you didn't negotiate it, or paying for a meal plan where you only use half of it.”</p><h3>Lean on available resources</h3><p>Many college campuses provide ample resources to their students.</p><p>For example, you might have access to a free gym on campus, which means you don't have to pay for an off-campus gym option. Other resources might include free tickets to sporting events, which offer a night of entertainment with minimal out-of-pocket costs. Some campuses offer free bike repair services, which might help you keep your transportation costs to a minimum.</p><p>Get creative about stretching your budget by leaning on the resources available on campus.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:308546":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"308546","content":"<p>One of the most intimidating parts of getting ready for college is figuring out how you’ll pay for it.

Personal loans usually have fixed rates and are unsecured, meaning they don't have any collateral. Instead, lenders rely on borrowers' creditworthiness to determine if the loan will likely be repaid.</p><p>There are virtually no limits on <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">personal loan uses</a>, making them popular for things like debt consolidation, medical costs, and major expenses such as vacations or weddings.</p><p>Personal loan limits, terms, and rates vary from lender to lender. You can generally find loans as high as $100,000 from certain lenders, with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> of up to about seven years. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">Personal loan rates</a> depend heavily on your credit score, but rates available through lenders on the Credible platform currently range from 6.49% to 35.99%.</p><h2>What is a student loan?</h2><p>A student loan is a type of installment loan that's specifically designed for educational expenses. Like personal loans, most student loans are fixed-rate term loans. The amount you can borrow is based on your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cost-of-college\">cost of attendance</a>. Most student loans don't require you to make payments while you're in school. You'll start repayment after you leave, often after a grace period.</p><p>There are two different types of student loans: <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/types-of-student-loans\">federal and private</a>. Federal student loans are funded by the federal government, while private loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and other private lenders.</p><p>While federal and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> have a similar purpose, they differ in terms of eligibility requirements, interest rates, and repayment options.</p><p>Generally speaking, there are more <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">federal loan benefits and protections</a>. For example, your credit score isn't a factor in qualifying for most federal loans. You don't have to make payments while in school. You can choose from a variety of repayment plans, including income-based options, and you're eligible for borrower protections like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> and loan forgiveness.</p><p>While private loans don't have as many perks, they're a good option for borrowers who can't get enough through federal loans to cover all of their expenses.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15230":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15230","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:308554":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"308554","content":"<h2>How do personal and student loans compare?</h2><p>Personal loans and student loans have a few things in common.

The higher interest rates, shorter repayment terms, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">stricter eligibility requirements</a> make personal loans a worse choice. However, there may be some situations where they’re the best option.</p><p>First, a personal loan could be a suitable option if you’re not eligible for student loans. Federal student loans require that you enroll at least half-time in an eligible degree program. If you’re attending school less than half-time or are completing a certificate program that’s not considered an eligible program, a personal loan could take the place of a student loan.</p><p>A personal loan might also make sense to supplement your student loans if you have expenses above and beyond what your student loans can pay for.</p><p>“Student loans can be used for off-campus housing, but only up to the cost estimated by the college,” says Jack Wang, a wealth adviser with Innovative Advisory Group who specializes in helping families with college financial aid. “However, if actual housing costs exceed the estimate, a personal loan could be used to cover that difference.”</p><p>According to Wang, a personal loan could also serve as a sort of bridge loan if you need temporary cash while you’re waiting for a student loan or another source of funds to come in.</p><p>“If a family is expecting a bonus or other windfall to pay for college, but [it] will not arrive until after the tuition bill is paid, a personal loan can be used to pay tuition and cover that time,” says Wang.</p><h2>When is a student loan the better option?</h2><p>Student loans are almost always a better option than personal loans to pay for your education expenses.</p><p>“A student loan is usually the better move for a student, especially if the student does qualify for federal loans,” says Jocelyn Pearson, the founder of The Scholarship System, which helps families figure out how to pay for school. “It tends to have lower interest, more flexible repayment, and sometimes even forgiveness options.”</p><p>As noted above, the federal government sets a fixed interest rate for student loans. It’s almost always lower than the rate you could get on a personal loan, even if you have excellent credit. The lower rate, combined with the longer repayment terms on student loans, makes for more affordable payments.</p><p>Student loans are also deferred while you’re in school, while a personal loan would require immediate repayment.

But the average interest rate on a two-year personal loan is more than 9 percentage points lower than the average credit card interest rate, according to Federal Reserve data.</li><li><strong>Repaying a loan can improve your credit:</strong> Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, more than any other factor. Successfully repaying a loan could help you see gradual improvements.</li><li><strong>An investment in your health:</strong> Various research studies have found that vacations can reduce stress, depression, and even heart disease. Vacation can also help you catch up on sleep (important for preventing the risk of dementia).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You get to go on vacation:</strong>&nbsp;This is the biggest reason to get a vacation loan. Tomorrow is never guaranteed, and there are great experiences to be had in the world. While you can’t always splurge on travel, it’s important to occasionally take time away from work and school to see the world and spend time with loved ones.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Borrowing costs:</strong>&nbsp;Because of interest and potential upfront fees, financing a vacation makes it more expensive than paying out of pocket. For instance, funding a $10,000 vacation with a five-year loan at 18% APR would cost you $5,236 in interest over the life of the loan. You can use our&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to find out how much a vacation loan will really cost you.</li><li><strong>Ties up budget:</strong>&nbsp;Funding a trip with a vacation loan offers instant gratification; you can have the trip of a lifetime. But when you’re back, you’ll be paying for that trip for years to come, meaning you’ll have less in your monthly budget to pay for other wants and needs. In the example above, that $10,000 vacation would cost $254 a month in monthly payments for five years.</li><li><strong>May not be practical:</strong>&nbsp;With other personal loans, such as a <a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement loan</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation loan</a>, you have a financial incentive. You can improve the resale value of your home, and you can save money in the long run when consolidating high-interest debts. That isn’t so for vacation loans.</li><li><strong>The application can ding your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;Although repaying a loan can improve your credit score in the long run, a hard credit inquiry from a loan application can <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">temporarily decrease your credit score</a> by as much as 10 points for up to a year. Increased credit utilization could also bring down your score.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Types of vacation loans</h2><p>Common ways to pay for a vacation include personal loans and credit cards — ideally, a travel credit card that offers rewards points and/or discounts. However, “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) financing is becoming an increasingly popular way to split the cost of major purchases, including travel, into smaller payments over time.</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p>Personal loans are among the most flexible types of loans available, because you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">use personal loans for almost anything</a>. While many borrowers rely on them for debt consolidation, home renovation, and emergency expenses, you can also take out a personal loan for experiences and special occasions, such as vacations and weddings.</p><p>Any type of travel financing involves cost. With personal loans, there are two major costs: origination fees and interest.</p><ul><li><strong>Origination fees:</strong>&nbsp;Many personal loan lenders charge upfront&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> ranging between 0% and 15% of the amount borrowed. The fee is typically deducted from the loan proceeds. For instance, a 5% origination fee on a $10,000 loan means you’d receive $9,500 but you’d have to repay $10,000, plus interest. Some lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">personal loans without origination fees</a>, but those are often reserved for borrowers with very good or excellent credit.</li><li><strong>Interest:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Personal loan interest rates</a> vary between 6.49% and 35.99%, depending on your credit score, income, loan amount, loan term, and other factors. Borrowers with excellent credit tend to qualify for the lowest rates. Borrowers with poor credit can qualify for some personal loans, but options are limited to a handful of lenders and interest rates are typically high.</li></ul><p>Despite the costs of interest and fees, personal loans are typically more affordable than other options such as credit cards and offer longer repayment terms than BNPL financing.</p><h3>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">Buy now, pay later (BNPL)</a> has become a popular way to cover expenses both large and small. While the programs vary by BNPL lender, you’ll often make one payment at the time of purchase, and then make additional payments (often four total) over the next one to two months to fully pay off what you borrow. You might also find 6-24 month 0% APR offers with booking sites, hotels, airlines, and on experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s typically no interest for short-term repayment plans, some BNPL companies do charge interest (up to 35.99%) for longer-term repayments. There is also a risk of late fees if you miss a payment.</p><p>Depending on the travel purchase you’re making, you might be able to use a traditional BNPL lender such as Affirm or Klarna. For instance, Klarna lets you shop directly in the app when you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.klarna.com/us/store/f8ddeb8e-1604-4732-84c5-744e2616846e/Vacations-Made-Easy/pay-with-klarna/\">search for “Vacations Made Easy.”</a> You can also look for vacation-specific BNPL programs, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.expedia.com/lp/b/vacations/payment-plans\">Expedia’s “book now, pay later” option</a>.</p><p>Note that your purchasing power may be limited with BNPL, which could make it challenging to finance an entire vacation.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Paying for a trip on a credit card can be costly because of high interest rates. But if you’re able to find a credit card with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% introductory APR</a>, you might be able to pay for your vacation and pay it off before interest ever starts to accumulate. The key is not using the credit card for any other purchases and staying focused on paying off the card before the intro rate expires.</p><p>Plus, some cards often offer sign-up bonuses with major cash back or rewards points when you spend a certain amount in the first few months. Continued usage of the card could earn you even more cash back or points — and some rewards credit cards offer travel insurance. Just watch out for annual fees.</p><p>But be careful: Managing a credit card can be tricky. It’s easy to fall into high-interest debt when you spend more than you can afford to repay soon after. U.S. households are shouldering a combined $1.23 trillion in credit card debt, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>.</p><h2>How much does a vacation cost?</h2><p><a href=\"https://nextvacay.com/how-much-does-a-vacation-cost?\">NextVacay</a> estimates an average cost of $1,550 for a solo traveler vacationing in the U.S. but $2,300 for that same traveler to vacation abroad.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313334":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313334","content":"<p>The cost of a vacation can vary significantly depending on factors including:</p><ul><li>The destination</li><li>The time of year</li><li>The number of people in the travel party</li><li>Modes of transportation</li><li>The type of lodging</li></ul><p>For instance, it’s easy to travel on a budget if you drive to a destination, pack your own food, and stick to mostly free activities, such as hiking in a national park or visiting family and friends in another location.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313314":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313314","content":"<h3>Vacation costs breakdown</h3><p>Here’s a breakdown of specific vacation expenses and their estimated average costs.</p><ul><li><strong>Airfare:&nbsp;</strong>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/averagefare/\">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the average domestic flight costs $385.50. International flight prices vary significantly depending on which country you’re flying to, but on average, expect to spend around $1,200 for economy class.</li><li><strong>Hotels:</strong>&nbsp;Lodging costs can also vary dramatically, from a cheap campsite to a five-star hotel in a major city. Alternative lodging options such as Airbnb and VRBO add even more variability into the mix. Still,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/nxpteyfv/media-studio/a823e1efe5c00b8ca0d6c3a09d5f374f0cbb7b78.pdf\">Hotels.com</a> found that the average 3-star hotel costs $152 a night while the average 5-star hotel costs $430 a night.</li><li><strong>Rental cars:</strong>&nbsp;The cost to rent a car for your vacation depends on where you rent, for how long, the type of vehicle, and the insurance add-ons you opt for. That said,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-rent-a-car\">Fidelity</a> reports that rental cars cost between $50 and $80 per day on average, before taxes and fees.</li><li><strong>Food:</strong>&nbsp;How much you spend on food while on vacation depends on how many people are in your party and your dining preferences. You may also cut out food prices entirely by opting for an all-inclusive hotel or cruise ship or by packing food and making your own meals. Navy Federal Credit Union reports that travelers spend about $58 a day per person on food.</li><li><strong>Tickets and tours:</strong>&nbsp;Tickets and tours can vary dramatically. You might find a free art museum in the city, but you may pay more than $200 for a one-day ticket to Magic Kingdom. One-day tours through organizers such as Viator may cost under $100, or you can book entire guided vacations with companies such as National Geographic Expeditions and pay tens of thousands of dollars.</li><li><strong>Travel insurance:&nbsp;</strong>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squaremouth.com/travel-advice/cost-for-travel-insurance\">SquareMouth</a>, the average cost of travel insurance for a 15-day trip is $311 per policy, but costs can vary depending on several factors, including the depth of coverage and the cost of your trip.</li></ul><h3>Watch out for hidden costs</h3><p>Vacations can also have a lot of hidden costs. Jeff Powell, a travel blogger and custom trip planner with Smoky Mountains Ventures Custom Travel Planning, warns of costs that many travelers forget to budget for, including:</p><ul><li>Tourist taxes (sometimes called a lodging or hotel tax) on top of regular sales taxes</li><li>Parking (“Some cities only offer public parking, often at a cost of $20 a day,” says Powell)</li><li>Tips and gratuities</li><li>Currency exchange rates and foreign transaction fees</li><li>Transportation costs like gas, tolls, rideshare, and public transport</li><li>Vaccinations, depending on where you’re traveling</li><li>Impulse purchases</li></ul><p>When you’re on vacation, you might want to treat yourself more than you would at home. Overestimate when making your meal and souvenir budgets. And remember that tourist destinations may have higher prices than what you’re used to back home.</p><h2>Interest costs by loan type</h2><p>Interest rates for vacation loans vary depending on the type of loan. For instance:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal loans:&nbsp;</strong>Personal loan interest rates typically range from 6.49% to 35.99%, but the rate you qualify for depends on factors including your credit score and income, the loan amount, and the length of the repayment term.</li><li><strong>Credit cards:</strong>&nbsp;Credit cards are a form of revolving credit and typically have variable rates. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">Federal Reserve</a>, the average credit card rate was 21.39%. As mentioned previously, you may be able to qualify for a 0% APR introductory rate for a credit card, often for 12 or more months.</li><li><strong>BNPL:</strong>&nbsp;Buy now, pay later loans are attractive because they generally offer interest-free short-term repayment options. However, repaying a short-term loan can prove challenging, meaning you might end up paying late fees. BNPL lenders also have longer-term repayment options with rates as high as 35.99%.</li></ul><p>To better illustrate how vacation loan rates differ, let’s look at an example in which you borrow $7,500 to pay for a vacation using different types of loans.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313338":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313338","content":"<h2>Vacation loan interest rates</h2><p>The better your credit score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be.

Here’s&nbsp;how to apply for a personal loan to fund your travels:</p><h3>1. Estimate how much you need to borrow</h3><p>Borrowing money for a vacation can be expensive. That’s why it’s crucial to only borrow what you need — and not a cent more. Here’s how:</p><ul><li>Calculate the full cost of your trip, including lodging, airfare, ground/water transportation, meals, souvenirs, and activities.</li><li>Add a little extra for unexpected or emergency expenses if you won’t be able to pay for these with a credit card.</li><li>Subtract whatever cash you have saved that you’re willing to spend on the vacation.</li></ul><p>These calculations will tell you the amount you need to borrow. If the lender you choose <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">charges&nbsp;an&nbsp;origination fee</a> and deducts it upfront, you may need to borrow a little more to ensure you get the full amount of money you need.</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">How Much of a Personal Loan Can I Get?</a></p><h3>2. Compare lenders</h3><p>Visit local banks and credit unions, and research online lenders using an online loan marketplace. Many lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalification</a> with no hard credit check, which provides quotes estimating APRs, loan amounts, repayment terms, and fees. Note that prequalification is a way to see quotes, not an actual offer of credit. The terms of a loan offer may differ from prequalification results.</p><p>Look at lenders side-by-side, comparing their interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and loan amounts. You may also want to consider factors such as customer service or funding speed, if you need cash urgently.</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans: A Step-by-Step Guide&nbsp;</a></p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15606":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15606","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"embedded-prequal","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313330","content":"<h3>3.

Your payment history, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score, is the single most important factor affecting your credit score. As long as you make on-time payments over the life of the loan, you may see your score gradually improve.</p><p>An installment loan for a vacation could also diversify your credit mix. Diversified credit can help improve your credit score. If you don’t already have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-is-an-installment-loan\">installment loan</a>, adding a vacation loan can have a minor positive impact on your credit score over time because your credit becomes more diverse.</p><h3>How it can hurt</h3><p>Taking out a personal loan to pay for a vacation could have a small, negative impact on your score initially. A hard credit inquiry from a personal loan application could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for as long as one year.</p><p>It’s important to stay on top of monthly payments. Lenders report missed payments to the credit bureaus, which could result in a drop in your credit score.</p><p><strong>Learn More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-does-a-personal-loan-affect-credit-score\">How Does a Personal Loan Affect Your Credit Score?</a></p><h2>Tips on getting a vacation loan with bad credit</h2><p>Lenders often have strict credit requirements for personal loans, but that doesn’t mean a low credit score will entirely prevent you from financing a vacation. Here are some ways to get a personal loan with bad credit:</p><ul><li><strong>Research specific lenders:</strong> Some online lenders specialize in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">personal loans for borrowers with bad credit</a>. Limit your search to such lenders, but understand you may pay more in interest and fees to cover the risk for the lender.</li><li><strong>Add a cosigner:</strong> You can improve your odds of approval by applying for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loan with a cosigner</a>. The cosigner — usually a trusted loved one — should have good or excellent credit, thus improving your odds and helping you get a lower interest rate. Bear in mind: If you fall behind on payments, you can impact their credit score and finances, too. Not every lender allows a cosigner, so you’ll have to limit your search. These are the best personal loans with cosigner options.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> Secured personal loans are an option for borrowers with bad credit. These loans require some kind of collateral, such as a car, an investment account, or high-value goods, like jewelry or artwork. Here are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">best secured personal loans</a> for vacations.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to vacation loans</h2><p>Vacation loans are a viable option for financing a vacation for which you can’t pay out of pocket, but there are other options to consider:</p><h3>Credit card</h3><p>Paying for a trip on a credit card can be costly because of high interest rates. But if you’re able to find a credit card with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\">0% introductory APR</a>, you might be able to pay for your vacation and pay it off before interest ever starts to accumulate. The key is&nbsp;not using the credit card for any other purchases and staying focused on paying off the card before the intro rate expires.</p><p>If your credit score is strong enough, you may be able to qualify for a travel credit card. These cards often offer sign-up bonuses with major cash back or rewards points when you spend a certain amount in the first few months. Continued usage of the card could earn you even more cash back or points — and some rewards credit cards offer travel insurance. However, travel credit cards may charge steep annual fees.</p><h3>Payment plans</h3><p>Some types of travel, such as cruises, theme parks, and all-inclusive resorts, offer payment plans. If you book the travel far in advance, you could potentially have the trip paid off before you actually travel — with no need for a loan.</p><p>“Some of the biggest suppliers I work with, like Royal Caribbean and Disney, offer long-term payment plans with down to zero interest (Disney requires their Visa card),” says Julie de la Fe, a travel agent with Travelmation. “Disney Parks, Disney Cruise Line, and Princess Cruise Line also have deposits that are fully refundable until final payment. I encourage my clients to book these well in advance so they can pay them down over time with no penalty.”</p><p>Similarly, you can often book lodging via sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com with fully refundable deposits (or no payment until closer to the trip date), allowing you to back out if needed and giving you time to save up for the trip.</p><h3>Savings account</h3><p>If your vacation starts in a few weeks and you don’t have money saved up, you obviously can’t rely on your own savings. But if you start planning a vacation a year from now, you can deposit extra cash — a bonus from work, birthday money, tax refund, etc. — into a high-yield savings account, specifically to cover the cost of travel.</p><p>Getting a part-time job or side hustle to supplement your income can help you grow those savings faster.</p><h3>Family and friends</h3><p>If you’re traveling for a friend’s destination wedding or because your family has asked you to join a big reunion trip, you might feel pressured to go — even if you don’t have the money to do so. In such instances, it’s important to speak openly with your loved one about your financial pressures. In some cases, they may be willing to help you cover the travel costs.</p><p>Related: <a href=\"/personal-loan/family-loans\">Should You Borrow Money From a Family Member?&nbsp;</a></p><h3>Cheaper destination</h3><p>You could cut out the need for a vacation loan by choosing a more affordable destination — maybe even a staycation. For instance, international travel is usually more expensive than domestic travel. You can save a lot of money by driving somewhere new instead of flying, or visiting family in a neighboring city, state, or country who are willing to house you for free.</p><p>You can also cut down on vacation costs by packing a cooler with food or renting lodging with a kitchen and buying groceries at your destination. Trips based on free or affordable activities — such as state and national parks — can also save you money compared to cruises and theme parks. All-inclusive resorts may also make sense if you’d otherwise be paying for food and drink a la carte.</p><h3>Credit card rewards</h3><p>Borrowers with good to excellent credit may qualify for travel rewards credit cards. These cards accrue “points” or “miles” with eligible purchases. You can then redeem those points or miles for travel expenses such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.</p><p>There are several types of travel credit cards, including:</p><ul><li>Typical travel credit cards, which may earn higher rates of points or miles per dollar spent depending on the purchase category</li><li>Flat-rate travel credit cards, which earn the same number of points or dollars per purchase no matter what you spend money on</li><li>Co-branded credit cards with an airline or hotel chain, which offer more points when you make purchases with that specific brand</li><li>Premium travel credit cards, which may come with additional travel perks</li></ul><p>Most of these cards offer perks for travelers, such as no foreign transaction fees, a credit toward travel programs like TSA PreCheck, and travel insurance. They may also have a sign-up bonus that could help cover the cost of a flight or hotel stay.</p><p>Travel credit cards can be a great way to pay for travel, but remember that some cards have steep annual fees. For example, the annual fee for the Chase Sapphire Reserve is $795. Unless you travel frequently for business or recreation and redeem your rewards strategically, a travel credit card with a high annual fee isn't recommended.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best personal loans for vacations.

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

While you can’t always splurge on travel, it’s important to occasionally take time away from work and school to see the world and spend time with loved ones.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Cons</h3><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Borrowing costs:</strong> Because of interest and potential upfront fees, financing a vacation makes it more expensive than paying out of pocket. For instance, funding a $10,000 vacation with a five-year loan at 18% APR would cost you $5,236 in interest over the life of the loan. You can use our <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-calculator.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan calculator</a> to find out how much a vacation loan will really cost you.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Ties up budget:</strong> Funding a trip with a vacation loan offers instant gratification; you can have the trip of a lifetime. But when you’re back, you’ll be paying for that trip for years to come, meaning you’ll have less in your monthly budget to pay for other wants and needs. In the example above, that $10,000 vacation would cost $254 a month in monthly payments for five years.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">May not be practical:</strong> With other personal loans, such as a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="home-improvement-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">home improvement loan</a> or <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="debt-consolidation-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">debt consolidation loan</a>, you have a financial incentive.

Increased credit utilization could also bring down your score. </li></ul><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="types-of-vacation-loans">Types of vacation loans</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Common ways to pay for a vacation include personal loans and credit cards — ideally, a travel credit card that offers rewards points and/or discounts. However, “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) financing is becoming an increasingly popular way to split the cost of major purchases, including travel, into smaller payments over time.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Personal loans</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Personal loans are among the most flexible types of loans available, because you can <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-are-personal-loans-used-for.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">use personal loans for almost anything</a>. While many borrowers rely on them for debt consolidation, home renovation, and emergency expenses, you can also take out a personal loan for experiences and special occasions, such as vacations and weddings.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Any type of travel financing involves cost. With personal loans, there are two major costs: origination fees and interest.</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Origination fees:</strong> Many personal loan lenders charge upfront <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="origination-fee.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">origination fees</a> ranging between 0% and 15% of the amount borrowed. The fee is typically deducted from the loan proceeds. For instance, a 5% origination fee on a $10,000 loan means you’d receive $9,500 but you’d have to repay $10,000, plus interest. Some lenders offer <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="no-origination-fee-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loans without origination fees</a>, but those are often reserved for borrowers with very good or excellent credit.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Interest:</strong> <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-interest-rates.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Personal loan interest rates</a> vary between 6.49% and 35.99%, depending on your credit score, income, loan amount, loan term, and other factors. Borrowers with excellent credit tend to qualify for the lowest rates. Borrowers with poor credit can qualify for some personal loans, but options are limited to a handful of lenders and interest rates are typically high.</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Despite the costs of interest and fees, personal loans are typically more affordable than other options such as credit cards and offer longer repayment terms than BNPL financing.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="buy-now-pay-later.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Buy now, pay later (BNPL)</a> has become a popular way to cover expenses both large and small. While the programs vary by BNPL lender, you’ll often make one payment at the time of purchase, and then make additional payments (often four total) over the next one to two months to fully pay off what you borrow. You might also find 6-24 month 0% APR offers with booking sites, hotels, airlines, and on experiences. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">While there’s typically no interest for short-term repayment plans, some BNPL companies do charge interest (up to 35.99%) for longer-term repayments. There is also a risk of late fees if you miss a payment.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Depending on the travel purchase you’re making, you might be able to use a traditional BNPL lender such as Affirm or Klarna. For instance, Klarna lets you shop directly in the app when you <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.klarna.com/us/store/f8ddeb8e-1604-4732-84c5-744e2616846e/Vacations-Made-Easy/pay-with-klarna/" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">search for “Vacations Made Easy.”</a> You can also look for vacation-specific BNPL programs, such as <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.expedia.com/lp/b/vacations/payment-plans" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Expedia’s “book now, pay later” option</a>.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Note that your purchasing power may be limited with BNPL, which could make it challenging to finance an entire vacation.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Credit cards</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Paying for a trip on a credit card can be costly because of high interest rates. But if you’re able to find a credit card with a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">0% introductory APR</a>, you might be able to pay for your vacation and pay it off before interest ever starts to accumulate. The key is not using the credit card for any other purchases and staying focused on paying off the card before the intro rate expires.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Plus, some cards often offer sign-up bonuses with major cash back or rewards points when you spend a certain amount in the first few months. Continued usage of the card could earn you even more cash back or points — and some rewards credit cards offer travel insurance. Just watch out for annual fees.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">But be careful: Managing a credit card can be tricky. It’s easy to fall into high-interest debt when you spend more than you can afford to repay soon after. U.S. households are shouldering a combined $1.23 trillion in credit card debt, according to the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ"

styles_bold__faN_F">Airfare: </strong>According to the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/averagefare/" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the average domestic flight costs $385.50. International flight prices vary significantly depending on which country you’re flying to, but on average, expect to spend around $1,200 for economy class.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Hotels:</strong> Lodging costs can also vary dramatically, from a cheap campsite to a five-star hotel in a major city. Alternative lodging options such as Airbnb and VRBO add even more variability into the mix. Still, <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/nxpteyfv/media-studio/a823e1efe5c00b8ca0d6c3a09d5f374f0cbb7b78.pdf" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Hotels.com</a> found that the average 3-star hotel costs $152 a night while the average 5-star hotel costs $430 a night.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Rental cars:</strong> The cost to rent a car for your vacation depends on where you rent, for how long, the type of vehicle, and the insurance add-ons you opt for. That said, <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-rent-a-car" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Fidelity</a> reports that rental cars cost between $50 and $80 per day on average, before taxes and fees.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Food:</strong> How much you spend on food while on vacation depends on how many people are in your party and your dining preferences. You may also cut out food prices entirely by opting for an all-inclusive hotel or cruise ship or by packing food and making your own meals. Navy Federal Credit Union reports that travelers spend about $58 a day per person on food.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tickets and tours:</strong> Tickets and tours can vary dramatically. You might find a free art museum in the city, but you may pay more than $200 for a one-day ticket to Magic Kingdom. One-day tours through organizers such as Viator may cost under $100, or you can book entire guided vacations with companies such as National Geographic Expeditions and pay tens of thousands of dollars.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Travel insurance: </strong>According to <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.squaremouth.com/travel-advice/cost-for-travel-insurance" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">SquareMouth</a>, the average cost of travel insurance for a 15-day trip is $311 per policy, but costs can vary depending on several factors, including the depth of coverage and the cost of your trip.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Watch out for hidden costs</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Vacations can also have a lot of hidden costs. Jeff Powell, a travel blogger and custom trip planner with Smoky Mountains Ventures Custom Travel Planning, warns of costs that many travelers forget to budget for, including:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Tourist taxes (sometimes called a lodging or hotel tax) on top of regular sales taxes</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Parking (“Some cities only offer public parking, often at a cost of $20 a day,” says Powell)</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Tips and gratuities</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Currency exchange rates and foreign transaction fees</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Transportation costs like gas, tolls, rideshare, and public transport</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Vaccinations, depending on where you’re traveling</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Impulse purchases</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When you’re on vacation, you might want to treat yourself more than you would at home. Overestimate when making your meal and souvenir budgets. And remember that tourist destinations may have higher prices than what you’re used to back home.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="interest-costs-by-loan-type">Interest costs by loan type</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Interest rates for vacation loans vary depending on the type of loan. For instance:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Personal loans: </strong>Personal loan interest rates typically range from 6.49% to 35.99%, but the rate you qualify for depends on factors including your credit score and income, the loan amount, and the length of the repayment term.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Credit cards:</strong> Credit cards are a form of revolving credit and typically have variable rates. According to the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Federal Reserve</a>, the average credit card rate was 21.39%. As mentioned previously, you may be able to qualify for a 0% APR introductory rate for a credit card, often for 12 or more months.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">BNPL:</strong> Buy now, pay later loans are attractive because they generally offer interest-free short-term repayment options. However, repaying a short-term loan can prove challenging, meaning you might end up paying late fees. BNPL lenders also have longer-term repayment options with rates as high as 35.99%.</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">To better illustrate how vacation loan rates differ, let’s look at an example in which you borrow $7,500 to pay for a vacation using different types of loans. </p></section><div class="mb-32"><div class="styles_tableContainer__Twqrz"><table

Your payment history, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score, is the single most important factor affecting your credit score. As long as you make on-time payments over the life of the loan, you may see your score gradually improve.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">An installment loan for a vacation could also diversify your credit mix. Diversified credit can help improve your credit score. If you don’t already have an <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-is-an-installment-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">installment loan</a>, adding a vacation loan can have a minor positive impact on your credit score over time because your credit becomes more diverse.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">How it can hurt</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Taking out a personal loan to pay for a vacation could have a small, negative impact on your score initially. A hard credit inquiry from a personal loan application could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for as long as one year.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">It’s important to stay on top of monthly payments. Lenders report missed payments to the credit bureaus, which could result in a drop in your credit score.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Learn More: </strong><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="how-does-a-personal-loan-affect-credit-score.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">How Does a Personal Loan Affect Your Credit Score?</a></p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="tips-on-getting-a-vacation-loan-with-bad-credit">Tips on getting a vacation loan with bad credit</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Lenders often have strict credit requirements for personal loans, but that doesn’t mean a low credit score will entirely prevent you from financing a vacation. Here are some ways to get a personal loan with bad credit:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Research specific lenders:</strong> Some online lenders specialize in <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="bad-credit-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loans for borrowers with bad credit</a>. Limit your search to such lenders, but understand you may pay more in interest and fees to cover the risk for the lender.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Add a cosigner:</strong> You can improve your odds of approval by applying for a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="best-personal-loans-with-cosigner.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">personal loan with a cosigner</a>. The cosigner — usually a trusted loved one — should have good or excellent credit, thus improving your odds and helping you get a lower interest rate. Bear in mind: If you fall behind on payments, you can impact their credit score and finances, too. Not every lender allows a cosigner, so you’ll have to limit your search. These are the best personal loans with cosigner options.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Offer collateral:</strong> Secured personal loans are an option for borrowers with bad credit. These loans require some kind of collateral, such as a car, an investment account, or high-value goods, like jewelry or artwork. Here are the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="secured-personal-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">best secured personal loans</a> for vacations.</li></ul><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="alternatives-to-vacation-loans">Alternatives to vacation loans</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Vacation loans are a viable option for financing a vacation for which you can’t pay out of pocket, but there are other options to consider:</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Credit card</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Paying for a trip on a credit card can be costly because of high interest rates. But if you’re able to find a credit card with a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">0% introductory APR</a>, you might be able to pay for your vacation and pay it off before interest ever starts to accumulate. The key is not using the credit card for any other purchases and staying focused on paying off the card before the intro rate expires.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If your credit score is strong enough, you may be able to qualify for a travel credit card. These cards often offer sign-up bonuses with major cash back or rewards points when you spend a certain amount in the first few months. Continued usage of the card could earn you even more cash back or points — and some rewards credit cards offer travel insurance. However, travel credit cards may charge steep annual fees.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Payment plans</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some types of travel, such as cruises, theme parks, and all-inclusive resorts, offer payment plans. If you book the travel far in advance, you could potentially have the trip paid off before you actually travel — with no need for a loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">“Some of the biggest suppliers I work with, like Royal Caribbean and Disney, offer long-term payment plans with down to zero interest (Disney requires their Visa card),” says Julie de la Fe, a travel agent with Travelmation. “Disney Parks, Disney Cruise Line, and Princess Cruise Line also have deposits that are fully refundable until final payment. I encourage my clients to book these well in advance so they can pay them down over time with no penalty.”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Similarly, you can often book lodging via sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com with fully refundable deposits (or no payment until closer to the trip date), allowing you to back out if needed and giving you time to save up for the trip.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Savings account</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If your vacation starts in a few weeks and you don’t have money saved up, you obviously can’t rely on your own savings. But if you start planning a vacation a year from now, you can deposit extra cash — a bonus from work, birthday money, tax refund, etc. — into a high-yield savings account, specifically to cover the cost of travel.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Getting a part-time job or side hustle to supplement your income can help you grow those savings faster.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Family and friends</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you’re traveling for a friend’s destination wedding or because your family has asked you to join a big reunion trip, you might feel pressured to go — even if you don’t have the money to do so. In such instances, it’s important to speak openly with your loved one about your financial pressures. In some cases, they may be willing to help you cover the travel costs.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Related: <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="family-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Should You Borrow Money From a Family Member? </a></p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Cheaper destination</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You could cut out the need for a vacation loan by choosing a more affordable destination — maybe even a staycation. For instance, international travel is usually more expensive than domestic travel. You can save a lot of money by driving somewhere new instead of flying, or visiting family in a neighboring city, state, or country who are willing to house you for free.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You can also cut down on vacation costs by packing a cooler with food or renting lodging with a kitchen and buying groceries at your destination. Trips based on free or affordable activities — such as state and national parks — can also save you money compared to cruises and theme parks. All-inclusive resorts may also make sense if you’d otherwise be paying for food and drink a la carte.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Credit card rewards</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Borrowers with good to excellent credit may qualify for travel rewards credit cards. These cards accrue “points” or “miles” with eligible purchases. You can then redeem those points or miles for travel expenses such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">There are several types of travel credit cards, including:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Typical travel credit cards, which may earn higher rates of points or miles per dollar spent depending on the purchase category</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Flat-rate travel credit cards, which earn the same number of points or dollars per purchase no matter what you spend money on</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Co-branded credit cards with an airline or hotel chain, which offer more points when you make purchases with that specific brand</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Premium travel credit cards, which may come with additional travel perks</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Most of these cards offer perks for travelers, such as no foreign transaction fees, a credit toward travel programs like TSA PreCheck, and travel insurance. They may also have a sign-up bonus that could help cover the cost of a flight or hotel stay.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Travel credit cards can be a great way to pay for travel, but remember that some cards have steep annual fees. For example, the annual fee for the Chase Sapphire Reserve is $795. Unless you travel frequently for business or recreation and redeem your rewards strategically, a travel credit card with a high annual fee isn&#x27;t recommended.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Credible evaluated <strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best personal loans for vacations.

Your actual rate may be different from the rates advertised and/or shown above and will be based on factors such as the term of your loan, your financial history (including your cosigner’s (if any) financial history) and the degree you are in the process of achieving or have achieved. While not always the case, lower rates typically require creditworthy applicants with creditworthy cosigners, graduate degrees, and shorter repayment terms (terms vary by lender and can range from 5-20 years) and include loyalty and Automatic Payment discounts, where applicable. Loyalty and Automatic Payment discount requirements as well as Lender terms and conditions will vary by lender and therefore, reading each lender’s disclosures is important.
