Getting approved for a personal loan with a 500 credit score is more challenging — and expensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some lenders specialize in bad credit personal loans, but the origination fees and interest rates will likely be significantly higher, and loan amounts and terms are often stricter. You may also be able to <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">get a secured personal loan</a> (requiring collateral) or a loan with a co-borrower who has a stronger credit score.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to get a bad credit personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The time it takes to get a personal loan with bad credit depends on the lender. Some lenders approve applications and can <a href=\"/personal-loan/direct-deposit-loans\">send money to your bank account</a> all in one day. But other lenders may take a few business days.

is home equity?</h2><p>Home equity is the difference between what your home could sell for and the balance on your mortgage. In most cases, home equity builds over time as you pay down the&nbsp;home loan&nbsp;and wait for your home to gain value.</p><h3>Calculating the equity in your home</h3><p>You can calculate your home equity by subtracting your mortgage balance from the home’s market value.</p><p>Let’s say your home is worth $300,000 and you still owe $210,000 on the mortgage. Your home equity would be $90,000:</p><blockquote><p><strong>$300,000 – $210,000 = $90,000</strong></p></blockquote><p>Check your most recent billing statement to find your mortgage balance, or call the loan servicer to ask. To estimate your market value, you can look at recent, comparable home sales in your area or check third-party websites such as Zillow and Redfin.</p><h2>How home equity works</h2><p>When you take out a mortgage, lenders usually require a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/down-payment\">down payment</a>. That money becomes your original equity stake, and you build more equity as you pay down the loan.</p><p>Homeowners with shorter loan terms build equity faster because they make larger payments over a shorter time frame.</p><p>Home equity is influenced by two factors — your mortgage balance and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-increase-home-value\">home’s value</a>&nbsp;— and changes over time. To get an idea of how it works, take a look at one example:</p><p>Say you take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an APR of 3% for a home worth $300,000. After making your down payment of 20%, your equity starts at&nbsp;<strong>$60,000</strong>,&nbsp;and your mortgage balance starts at $240,000.</p><p>After making on-time payments for five years, the mortgage balance decreases to $213,430. And because real estate prices have increased in your area, your home is now valued at $350,000.</p><p>You crunch the numbers to get your current home equity: $350,000 – $213,430 =&nbsp;<strong>$136,570</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Good to know:</strong>&nbsp;This process also works in reverse. In the above example, say that in another five years, home values have dipped — and your home is now worth $290,000.</p></blockquote><p>Your mortgage balance has decreased to $182,566, but because of the decrease in value, your home equity drops a bit as well: $290,000 – $182,566 =&nbsp;<strong>$107,434</strong>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:21418":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"21418","content":"<h2>How to build home equity</h2><p>Home equity usually grows over time — which benefits you — and there are ways to move it along:</p><h3>Make your mortgage payments</h3><p>Every time you make a monthly mortgage payment, you gain a little more equity in the home. That’s because a portion of your monthly mortgage payment goes toward the principal balance on your home loan.</p><p>In the beginning, a smaller amount goes toward the principal and more goes toward interest.</p><p>This process, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-amortization\">amortization</a>, means you usually build more equity toward the end of the loan term. Once the principal is paid off, you own the entire home.</p><p>Use our <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">mortgage calculator to see your amortization plan</a>.</p><h3>Pay your mortgage down faster</h3><p>Many lenders allow homeowners to make additional payments toward their principal. This can help you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/pay-off-early\">pay off your mortgage sooner</a>, build equity faster, and save on interest.</p><p>Talk with your lender about this strategy and ask if the mortgage comes with prepayment penalties. Once you start making extra payments, tell your lender that they should be applied to the principal only.</p><p>You don’t have to make big payments, either. Some homeowners choose to:</p><ul><li>Make one extra mortgage payment every year</li><li>Add extra money to each monthly payment</li><li>Use any one-time windfalls, such as a work bonus or inheritance, to pay down the principal</li></ul><h3>Wait for your property value to rise</h3><p>Equity is also based on the market value of the home. Fortunately, home values tend to rise over time — even if you do nothing to the property.</p><p>Over the past 25 years, homes appreciated by 3.9% per year on average, according to mortgage data firm Black Knight.</p><p>Say you pay $300,000 for your home with $60,000 down. That gives you a $240,000 principal balance and $60,000 in equity right off the bat. After making on-time payments for one year, say your principal balance is now $234,000 — $6,000 less than when you started. Assuming the value of your home remains the same, you would have $66,000 in equity.</p><p>Using Black Knight’s average, if the home value increases 3.9%, or $11,700, over the year, your equity would increase by the same amount. In this example, your home would now be worth $311,700, and you would have $77,135 in equity:</p><blockquote><p><strong>$311,700 (value) – $234,000 (principal balance) = $77,700 in equity</strong></p></blockquote><h3>Make a big down payment</h3><p>If you’ve not yet purchased a home, you can start with more equity by making a larger down payment. Each extra dollar you pay upfront increases your equity — and reduces the amount you need to finance.</p><h3>Refinance to a shorter loan term</h3><p>When you refinance from a 30-year loan to a 15- or 20-year loan, more of your payment goes toward the loan principal, so you build equity faster. In the case of a 30-year, $240,000 loan with a 3% fixed rate, you would build $5,435 in equity in the first year. That amount increases to $9,467 after the first year with a 20-year loan and $13,954 with a 15-year loan.</p><h3>Get rid of mortgage insurance</h3><p>This tip is a catch-22 in that you have to build equity to get rid of your mortgage insurance. Contact your lender once you reach 20% equity to request that the insurance be terminated — the lender might not do it automatically until you reach 22% equity.</p><p>Once you’re rid of the PMI premium, keep paying the same amount you paid before the PMI was discontinued. The extra payment will pay down the principal faster, increasing your equity as it does.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An even better option:</strong>&nbsp;Designate the additional amount as an extra principal payment each month. That way, you build equity faster while reducing the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.</p></blockquote><h3>Renovate your home</h3><p>Renovation projects — like adding a bedroom, remodeling the kitchen, and finishing the basement — could help boost your home’s market value. In turn, your home equity grows — as long as you don’t finance the work by borrowing against your house.</p><p>While you might not recoup all of the costs involved in a renovation project, homeowners typically get back most of the money they spend on average.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Talk with a real estate agent or a contractor to figure out how to maximize your home’s potential.</p></blockquote><h2>Why building equity in your home is important</h2><p>The more equity you build, the more protection you have against fluctuating property values, leaving you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/underwater-mortgage\">underwater on your mortgage</a>&nbsp;— that is, owing more on your mortgage than the home is worth.</p><p>While not a financial emergency in and of itself, being underwater can render you unable to sell your home. It also leaves you vulnerable to losing your home if you experience a financial setback like losing your job or incurring major medical expenses.</p><p>Even if you’re not underwater, low equity has a serious drawback: It makes the equity you do have inaccessible or expensive to access. Most lenders want you to have at least 20% equity to qualify for a home equity loan or cash-out refinance. Having less than 20% equity in your home may result in you paying higher interest rates or mortgage insurance to access the equity.</p><h2>How to use the equity in your home</h2><p>Your home equity makes up a part of your total net worth. You can tap into it by either selling the property or borrowing money and using the home as collateral. Here are some of your options:</p><h3>Buy a new home</h3><p>If you’re ready to sell your home, you can use the proceeds as a down payment when you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-buy-a-house\">buy a new place</a>. Making a large down payment can help shrink the size of your new monthly mortgage payments since you’re borrowing less.</p><p>And if you put down at least 20% of the home’s value, you could also avoid private mortgage insurance.</p><h3>Pay for home improvements</h3><p>Using your equity to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance-for-home-improvement\">improve your home</a>&nbsp;can be a smart way to invest in your property since it can help boost the market value.</p><p>You don’t have to go for big projects, either. Common home improvement projects that can help preserve or increase your home’s resale price include:</p><ul><li>Making repairs</li><li>Painting</li><li>Deep cleaning</li><li>Preventive maintenance</li><li>Landscaping</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>If you’d rather not use your equity to pay for renovations, you may want to consider a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement loan</a>&nbsp;instead.</p></blockquote><h3>Pay off high-interest debt</h3><p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit tend to have lower interest rates than personal loans, credit cards, and other types of debt products.</p><p>Using this strategy, you tap your home equity at a low interest rate, pay off your higher-interest debts, and pay down the new loan over time — saving money in the process.</p><h3>Use it for retirement</h3><p>Home equity helps to secure your retirement even if you’re unable to pay off your mortgage before you retire. You can supplement your Social Security and retirement savings income with the equity in your home, using it to pay for medical expenses, home improvements, or whatever you wish.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;If you haven’t paid off your mortgage by the time you retire, and you’ve made extra payments over the years, or plan to make a lump sum payment to further increase your equity, consider asking your lender to recast your mortgage. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage-recast\">mortgage recast</a>&nbsp;can reduce your monthly payment without changing your interest rate, and it’s significantly cheaper than a refinance.</p></blockquote><h2>How to borrow against home equity</h2><p>If you’re looking to take advantage of your home equity without selling your home, you have a few options.</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:</strong>&nbsp;Paying for one-time expenses</p></blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a>&nbsp;is a second mortgage that uses the property as collateral. You receive the money in one lump sum upfront, then pay it back in installments over a specified number of years.</p><p>The maximum amount you can borrow with a home equity loan varies by lender, but it’s typically around 85% of the equity in your home. So, if you have $110,000 in equity, then you might be able to borrow up to $93,500.</p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who aren’t sure how much money they’ll need</p></blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/heloc\">home equity line of credit</a>&nbsp;is another type of second mortgage. Instead of getting money upfront, though, you get access to a line of credit.</p><p>You can borrow from the line of credit anytime during a “draw period,” which usually lasts around 10 years. If you pay off any of the balance during that time, the line of credit replenishes—much like a credit card.</p><p>The amount you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">borrow on a HELOC</a>&nbsp;varies, but it’s usually around 75% to 85% of the value of your home, minus your mortgage balance.</p><p>So, if your home is worth $290,000 and you owe $185,000 on the mortgage, then the most you can borrow is $61,500.</p><h3>Cash-out refinance</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who want new loan terms</p></blockquote><p>With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a>, you take out a new mortgage that’s bigger than your current balance, use the proceeds to pay off the original loan, and pocket the difference.</p><p>Because you’re getting a new loan, your terms can be more suitable to your current situation.</p><p>For instance, you might change the loan term, get a lower interest rate, or shift from an adjustable-rate mortgage to one with a fixed rate.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Good to know:&nbsp;</strong>Lenders usually limit the amount you can borrow on a cash-out refinance to 80% of your home’s total value, less whatever you still owe on your mortgage.</p></blockquote><p>Say your home is worth $290,000 and you owe $185,000. The most you can borrow with a cash-out refinance loan in this case is $232,000 — $185,000 to pay off your existing loan, plus $47,000 in cash.</p><h3>Reverse mortgage</h3><p><strong>Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Homeowners who are at least 62 years old and have enough equity</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-does-a-reverse-mortgage-work\">reverse mortgage</a>&nbsp;is a special type of home loan that’s available to homeowners who are at least 62 years old. The amount you can borrow is based on how much equity you have in your home.</p><p>Once you receive the money, you’ll pay off any existing mortgage balance and use the remaining funds as you see fit. Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, the loan is repaid when you die, sell the home, or move out.</p><p>Aside from the age requirement, you’ll need to meet a few other requirements to be eligible.

If you have an adjustable-rate VA loan, you can use a VA IRRRL to switch to a fixed-rate loan.</p><p>One of the main advantages of a VA IRRRL is they’re relatively easy to qualify for and require less paperwork than a conventional refinance, which often results in a faster closing time. You also won’t need a home appraisal in most instances and may not need to pay out-of-pocket closing costs.</p><h3>What are the requirements for a VA IRRRL?</h3><p>To qualify for a VA streamline refinance loan, you’ll need to meet these VA IRRRL requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Have a VA-backed mortgage:</strong>&nbsp;This program doesn’t accept non-VA loans. Only active duty, retired service members, and surviving spouses with an existing VA loan can apply.</li><li><strong>Proof of residence:</strong>&nbsp;You must certify that you live in the house you wish to refinance. If you have a second mortgage, that holder must also agree to your new loan terms.</li><li><strong>Certificate of Eligibility (COE):&nbsp;</strong>You can provide the COE from your existing VA loan so the lender can calculate your remaining entitlement. If you can’t provide your COE, your lender can retrieve a copy on your behalf.</li><li><strong>Payment history:&nbsp;</strong>Your current VA loan must also be at least 210 days old and have at least six monthly payments. Most lenders require that your last 12 monthly payments be on time. Otherwise, you may not be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-soon-to-refinance\">eligible for refinancing</a>&nbsp;into the VA streamline program.</li><li><strong>Credit score:&nbsp;</strong>The VA doesn’t require a minimum credit score, although lenders typically do. Most lenders require a minimum 620 FICO score, but several accept applications with&nbsp;bad credit&nbsp;as long as your score is above 580.</li><li><strong>Income:&nbsp;</strong>While the VA doesn’t have income or employment requirements, your lender may set a maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income (DTI) ratio</a>. It’s possible to qualify with a maximum 50% DTI, yet you should strive for a DTI below 41%.</li><li><strong>Net tangible benefit:&nbsp;</strong>Your new rate and term must also improve your financial situation. For example, your new interest rate might need to be at least 0.50% lower, reduce your monthly payment by at least $50, or convert an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan.</li></ul><p>Each lender has its own requirements that can affect your eligibility, rates, and fees. Comparing multiple lenders will help you find the best rates for your circumstances. Credible doesn’t offer VA IRRRLs, but we can help you compare refinance rates on conventional loans.</p><h3>What closing costs are associated with a VA IRRRL?</h3><p>Your lender may allow you to roll closing costs into your VA IRRRL. These costs are similar to your original purchase loan and usually fall between 2% and 5% of your loan amount.</p><p>However, you may decide to pay these expenses upfront to minimize your outstanding balance and get a lower monthly payment:</p><ul><li><strong>VA funding fee:&nbsp;</strong>For VA IRRRLs, you’ll pay a one-time 0.5% funding fee. This is the only VA-required fee.</li><li><strong>Loan origination fee:&nbsp;</strong>Your lender may charge a flat fee not exceeding 1% for expenses like document preparation, notary services, tax service, and settlement fees. The lender may also itemize these charges, but cannot exceed 1% to prevent “double charging.”</li><li><strong>Title examination and title insurance:&nbsp;</strong>Your lender may require you to pay a fee for a title search. A title search usually costs a few hundred dollars. You may also have to take out a new title insurance policy.</li><li><strong>Discount points:&nbsp;</strong>Buying <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-are-mortgage-points\">discount&nbsp;points</a>&nbsp;reduces your ongoing loan APR and monthly payment.</li><li><strong>Escrow fees:&nbsp;</strong>You’ll continue making escrow payments for your real estate taxes and home insurance. These payments don’t pay down your mortgage balance.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;You most likely won’t have to undergo another appraisal as your loan is already VA-insured and you’re not borrowing your home equity.</p><h2>Credible’s best VA mortgage lenders for a streamline refinance</h2><p>You might be able to find the best VA streamline refinance rates at these lenders:</p><ul><li><strong>Veterans United&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers seeking 24/7 customer service.</li><li><strong>Veterans First&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers seeking other government loan options.</li><li><strong>Rocket Mortgage&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers preferring a fully online application process.</li><li><strong>New American Funding&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers wanting the ability to easily choose a specific loan officer.</li><li><strong>Navy Federal Credit Union&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers seeking refinancing options tailored to service members.</li><li><strong>PenFed Credit Union</strong>&nbsp;— For borrowers seeking no lender fees.</li><li><strong>USAA&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers seeking a lender that specializes in VA loans.</li><li><strong>loanDepot&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers planning on refinancing multiple times.</li><li><strong>Guaranteed Rate&nbsp;</strong>— For borrowers with a low credit score.</li></ul><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/lender-review-methodology\">compares data points in nine categories</a> to determine some of the “best companies” in mortgage refinancing.

Calculate your DTI</h2><p>Your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) refers to the percentage of your gross monthly income that you spend making the minimum payments on all your debts. Lenders use your DTI to determine if you can handle an additional loan payment on top of your existing debts. To calculate your DTI:</p><ol><li>Divide your gross annual income by 12 to get your monthly income.</li><li>Add up your monthly minimum payments for your credit cards, mortgage, auto loan, and other outstanding debts.</li><li>Divide your total monthly debt payment by your gross monthly income.</li><li>Multiply the answer by 100 to get a percentage.</li></ol><p>For example, let's say your gross monthly income is $5,000 and your mortgage is $1,300. You also have a $200 minimum credit card payment and a $300 auto loan. Your DTI would be 36%.</p><p>($1,300 + $200 + $300) / $5,000 = 0.36</p><p>Some lenders set a maximum DTI, while others are more flexible.

Your gross income should include wages, tips, dividends you earn from investments, capital gains, any income you get from rental properties, alimony, and pensions.</p><h3>3. Determine how much you need to borrow (less than 5 minutes)</h3><p>This step will likely be the quickest of the process, as you probably already have a number in mind. If not, take a couple of minutes to pick a loan amount that meets — but does not exceed — your needs.</p><h3>4. Determine an affordable payment range (a few minutes to one hour)</h3><p>If you already have a budget, this step could take just three or four minutes. If you don't have a budget, it could take up to an hour to create a budget and figure out how big a monthly payment you can comfortably afford.</p><h3>5. Compare lenders (up to 30 minutes)</h3><p>This step can take some time since you'll need to search for multiple loan features, such as minimum credit score allowed (if you have bad credit), funding time, minimum and maximum loan amounts, and lender perks.</p><h3>6. Prequalify (five to 10 minutes or more)</h3><p>The time this step requires depends on how many lenders you want to prequalify with and how you go about prequalifying. Prequalification quotes can give you a sense of what different lenders may offer you. You can prequalify at individual lender sites, or you could prequalify with multiple lenders at once using a personal loan marketplace (using a loan marketplace is quicker).</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:4990":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"4990","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"embedded-prequal","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:208090":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"208090","content":"<h3>7.

It shields the lender against any financial losses incurred in the event of foreclosure.</p><p>You’ll typically need to get PMI if you put less than 20% down on a conventional home loan. PMI may also be required if you use a conventional loan to refinance a property with less than 20% equity.</p><p>Most lenders will add PMI to your monthly mortgage payment until you either request a PMI removal or it naturally falls off.. However, some will ask you to pay the full PMI premium upfront at closing. This means you won’t have to pay it each month, but the downside is that you might not get a refund if you choose to sell or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-refinance-your-mortgage\">refinance your home</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:206326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"206326","content":"<p>“PMI is an added expense that has no benefit for the homeowner. Dropping it will lower your monthly mortgage payment and free up cash for other financial goals (or just reduce your overall expenses),” says Steven Parangi, an attorney, licensed mortgage loan originator, and owner of Alpine Mortgage Services, LLC. “By getting rid of PMI more of your mortgage payment goes to reducing your principal balance and you’ll build equity in your home much faster.”</p><p>That said, PMI can make it easier to qualify for financing when you otherwise wouldn’t have. That’s because it offers an alternative to having to save up for a 20% down payment.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have PMI, check your loan estimate or closing disclosure to see how much you’re paying each month. It usually costs between 0.5% and 1% of the loan amount, but it can vary based on factors like your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/credit-score-for-home-loan\">credit score</a>, down payment amount, loan type, and repayment term.</p><p>PMI applies to conventional loans only. Government-backed loans, like FHA loans, may have their own mortgage insurance that works differently from PMI.</p><h2>When can PMI be removed automatically?</h2><p>One of the simplest ways to remove private mortgage insurance is to wait for the lender to automatically remove it when you reach sufficient equity. How long this takes depends on your repayment schedule<strong>, </strong>the property’s value, and your down payment<strong>.</strong></p><p>Your lender will cancel PMI once you’ve reached 22% <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-home-equity\">equity in your home</a> (based on your home’s original value). The faster you pay down your mortgage, the sooner you’ll get to this point. You must be current on all payments for your lender to eliminate PMI.</p><p>Say you took out a conventional loan for a home valued at $350,000. If you put 10% down ($35,000), your loan amount would be $315,000. You must pay off $77,000 (22% of your home’s value) for automatic PMI removal.</p><p>Put another way, your lender will cancel PMI once your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/loan-to-value-ratio-refinancing\">loan-to-value ratio (LTV)</a> — the amount owed compared to the property’s current value — is 78%. On a $350,000 home, that means your lender must automatically eliminate PMI once your loan balance is $273,000.</p><p>Private mortgage insurance cancellation may also occur at the midway point of your loan’s term — even if you haven’t reached 22% equity. On a typical 30-year loan, the midpoint would be after 15 years. This typically only occurs on mortgages with:</p><ul><li>An interest-only period</li><li>A balloon payment</li><li>Principal forbearance</li></ul><h2>How can you request PMI cancellation?</h2><p>If you’re tired of waiting for your lender to remove PMI, you can always ask to remove it once you reach 20% home equity. This applies to both purchases and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/refinance-requirements\">refinancing</a> and is based on your home’s original value.</p><p>You can check your PMI disclosure form, which you should receive at closing, to find out when you’ll reach 20% equity. If you don’t have this form, contact your loan servicer. If you’ve paid extra on your mortgage, you may be able to cancel PMI ahead of schedule.</p><p>You’ll need to meet the following criteria to cancel PMI:</p><ul><li><strong>Request it in writing: </strong>You’ll need to submit a written cancellation request to your lender.</li><li><strong>Have good payment history: </strong>All mortgage payments must be current.</li><li><strong>No junior liens: </strong>You must certify that you don’t have any liens or second mortgages on the property.</li><li><strong>Home value hasn’t declined: </strong>You must prove — usually through an appraisal — that your property value hasn’t fallen below its original value. If it has, you may have to keep PMI longer than anticipated.</li></ul><p>“While not exactly ‘creative,’ paying down your mortgage principal aggressively will reduce your loan balance faster and get you to 80% LTV,” Parangi says. “This can be done by making extra principal payments or refinancing into a shorter-term loan with higher payments. Making one extra payment a year applied to your principal will make a difference over the life of the loan.”</p><h2>Can refinancing help eliminate PMI?</h2><p>You might be able to get rid of PMI through mortgage refinancing. If you’re using a conventional loan, you’ll need to have at least 20% equity. Otherwise, PMI may still be required.</p><p>“Refinancing into a new loan can be used to get rid of PMI if the market value of the home has appreciated or if you have paid down your mortgage enough,” Parangi says. “If you refinance into a 80% LTV loan you may be able to drop your PMI.”</p><p>When you refinance a mortgage, your lender — whether it’s the same one or a different one — will typically order an appraisal. If your home has appreciated since the original loan, you could end up with more equity than you expected.</p><p>Be aware that <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/should-i-refinance-my-mortgage\">refinancing a mortgage</a> isn’t for everyone. You’ll need to consider the new loan’s interest rate, terms, and other factors to decide whether it makes sense for you. For example, if you get a much shorter term or higher APR, you could end up with a larger monthly payment — even without PMI.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:206330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"206330","content":"<h2>What are other strategies to get rid of PMI?</h2><p>There are several other ways to get rid of PMI, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Make additional or larger monthly payments: </strong>By paying more each month, you can reach 20% equity faster. This can help you remove private mortgage insurance sooner, while chipping away at your overall loan. It could even save you money in interest over time.</li><li><strong>Order a new appraisal: </strong>You don’t have to refinance to get a new appraisal. If you believe your home is worth significantly more than it was, get a professional appraisal done. This will tell you — and your lender — what your home is valued at. If you were already close to the 20% mark, the appraisal might even push you over the edge. Be sure to contact your lender or loan servicer once it’s done so they can take it into consideration.</li><li><strong>Consider upgrading your property: </strong>Renovating your home costs money, but it could increase its value.

Here’s what to consider:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:196542":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"196542","content":"<h3>Pros&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><strong>Large selection of home loans:</strong> Rate’s loan options include 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, jumbo loans, and VA and FHA loans. It also offers interest-only mortgages, a less common financing option that homebuyers with nontraditional income can use to pay only interest at the beginning of the loan.</li><li><strong>Also offers HELOCs:</strong> With a HELOC, you can use your home’s equity as collateral to secure a line of credit with Rate. Depending on how much equity you have, you could borrow between $25,000 and $400,000. Plus, the time to fund is typically five to 10 days. For other lenders, it’s often between 45 to 60 days.</li><li><strong>Fast pre-approval:</strong> Rate has a fast <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-is-a-mortgage-preapproval-good-for\">pre-approval timeline</a>. Once you submit your online application, Rate immediately reviews your information and will tell you whether you’re approved the same day.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fast close:</strong> Some homebuyers may be able to close in as few as 10 days with Rate.</li><li><strong>Low-down-payment loans: </strong>The Rate OneDown program offers low-down-payment options to qualified borrowers. Eligible first-time buyers can make a 1% down payment, and may qualify for an additional 2% or up to $2,000 toward the down payment. Rate also offers up to $1,000 toward lender fees.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><strong>Short draw period on HELOCs:</strong> Many lenders offer a draw period on HELOCs up to 10 years. Rate, however, only allows for a draw period between two and five years.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prepayment fee:</strong> Rate charges a prepayment fee, but it does not disclose how much in its fee schedule. Instead, it’s located in the borrower’s loan documents. If you know you’re going to pay off your loan in full before it matures, consider speaking with a loan officer before you choose Rate to find out how much the fee will be.</li><li><strong>Loan origination not fully disclosed online:</strong> Rate discusses loan origination fees on its blog, but doesn’t address the costs clearly on its main website. It states that, on average, buyers should expect to pay between 0.5% and 1.0%, but it's unclear if this is Rate’s full range for origination fees.</li></ul><h2>What to consider before applying&nbsp;</h2><p>Before you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage\">apply for a mortgage</a> with Rate, you may want to consider the lender’s reviews, rates, and fees.</p><p>While Rate’s mortgage interest rates are low, this doesn’t mean it’s the best offer you can find. When you take out a mortgage, it’s a good idea to shop around and compare multiple lenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what Rate charges for some common fees:</p><ul><li><strong>Late fee:</strong> If you make your mortgage payment after the due date, Rate charges up to 6% of the payment amount.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Insufficient funds fee:</strong> Should your bank or credit union report to Rate that there aren’t enough funds in your account to cover the payment, Rate may charge up to $50.</li><li><strong>Certified check fee: </strong>If you choose to make your mortgage payment with a certified check, Rate may charge you a $5 fee.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Title search and report fee:</strong> Rate charges up to $2,000 for a title search.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Rate has a <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/us/il/chicago/profile/mortgage-banker/rate-0654-28004028\">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> customer score of 3.92 out of 5 stars, and has an A+ rating from the company. While BBB has logged over 70 customer complaints, Rate does appear to take the time to reply to and resolve negative customer experiences. The lender has a lower customer review score on Trustpilot, with an average score of 2 stars out of 5.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to apply for a loan with Rate&nbsp;</h2><p>The steps to getting a home loan from Rate are pretty straightforward:</p><ul><li><strong>Check your credit score and credit reports: </strong>Before you apply for a loan, it’s a good idea to review your credit score and credit reports. Most importantly, look for errors. If you spot any, begin the dispute process as soon as possible to have them removed.</li><li><strong>Review Rate’s loan options and fee structures: </strong>While Rate has a wide array of loan options, it may not have what you're specifically looking for. While you’re reviewing Rate, also take a look at the fee schedule to make sure it compares well with other lenders you’re considering.</li><li><strong>Apply for pre-approval: </strong>Rate is able to expedite the pre-approval process and can make it happen within a single day. During this stage, you’ll need to submit <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval-documents\">pre-approval documents</a> online or through the mobile app. This will include providing a government-issued ID, proof of income and any other documents Rate may request.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Find a house:</strong> Once you’re pre-approved, you’ll know <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-much-to-offer-on-a-house\">how much you can offer</a> for a house. If you’re working with a real estate agent, they can help you find homes in your budget.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make a bid:</strong> Submit a bid through your real estate agent and begin the negotiation process. If your offer is accepted, you and the seller will sign a purchase agreement.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wait on underwriting:</strong> The underwriter will review the home you bid on and conduct a more thorough review of your finances. If you and the home are approved by Rate, a closing date will be set.</li><li><strong>Review and sign the loan agreement: </strong>Rate will provide a detailed document that outlines the terms and conditions of your loan. Review it carefully and ask questions.</li><li><strong>Close: </strong>At closing, you’ll have a few more documents to sign, and you’ll need to provide the down payment and pay any closing costs you’re responsible for. Once you do, the home is yours. Monthly mortgage payments will begin shortly thereafter.</li></ul><h2>How to qualify for a loan with Rate</h2><p>To qualify for a loan with Rate, buyers will need a secure income, a credit score of 620 or higher, and a low debt-to-income ratio (DTI). While lenders will look at a borrower’s entire credit profile, Rate generally allows a maximum DTI of 43%. When you calculate your DTI, keep in mind that many lenders want a mortgage payment to remain at or below 28% of the borrower's gross monthly income. However, there may be some wiggle room if you have a few other debts. A loan officer with Rate will review your financial situation and approve you for a specific loan amount.</p><h2>How to refinance with Rate</h2><p>A refinance can be a good idea if you can get a better rate or loan term. You may even want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/should-you-refinance-with-same-lender\">refinance with the same lender</a> you initially borrowed from.&nbsp;</p><p>To refinance with Rate, you’ll go through the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Submit an application with Rate:</strong> When you apply, you’ll need to provide documents including your current income, debts, assets and proof of insurance. Rate will review your documents and use that information to determine if you are eligible for a refinance.</li><li><strong>Get an appraisal on your home:</strong> Rate will send an appraiser to your home to determine its current value and loan-to-value ratio.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review terms and conditions of new loan:</strong> Depending on your home’s appraised value, Rate will offer you a refinance mortgage with a new interest rate and maturity date.</li><li><strong>Close: </strong>Just as when you buy a home, you’ll have to sign new documents and pay closing costs. Once you do, you’ll have a new mortgage on your home. Your new mortgage payment should begin shortly after closing.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How Rate compares&nbsp;</h2><p>Guaranteed Rate, recently rebranded to simply Rate, has a variety of loan options backed by a speedy process. The lender can provide pre-approval decisions as quickly as the same day, and complete some closings in as few as 10 days. Keep in mind that not all homebuyers will have a straightforward buying process that will ensure a fast experience.

This can lead to a larger monthly payment and higher interest payments over time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Less ideal terms: </strong>Without a down payment, a lender might consider you a higher risk. This could result in a higher interest rate or repayment terms that are less than ideal.</li><li><strong>Limited home equity: </strong>Home equity is what your property is worth after subtracting the existing mortgage.

If you’re struggling to make payments, you may be at risk of defaulting on your loans — which can quickly send you into a financial tailspin that takes years to recover from.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, you may be able to avoid default, even if you can’t pay your student loans. Here's what to do if you can't afford your payments.</p><h2>If you can’t pay your federal loans&nbsp;</h2><p>If you’ve fallen behind on your federal student loans and can’t pay, you aren’t without options. Consider the following <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-repayment-help\">ways to get help</a>:&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Contact your loan servicer</h3><p>Contacting your loan servicer to discuss your options should be your first step if you can’t pay your federal student loans. They can work with you to proactively find a solution before you miss a payment or your loan defaults, but you’ll need to call them to get the ball rolling.</p><p>You can find your federal student loan servicer by logging in to your <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/\">StudentAid.gov</a> account and visiting the “My Aid” page.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Consider deferment or forbearance</h3><p>After contacting your loan servicer and discussing your financial hardship, they may give you the option of loan deferment or forbearance. Both of these options can temporarily pause your loan payments, giving you time to figure out how to afford them.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Deferment: </strong>You might qualify for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">federal deferment</a> if you’re dealing with economic hardship, unemployment, or you’re on active-duty military service, among other circumstances. Interest will continue to accrue during deferment, unless you have Direct Subsidized Loans or Perkins Loans. In those instances, the government will cover interest costs during qualifying deferment periods. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Forbearance: </strong>You may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forbearance\">forbearance</a> if you’re serving in AmeriCorps, working through a medical internship or residency, working as a teacher, or if your student loan payments are high relative to your income. Interest accrues on all federal loan types during forbearance.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>3. Change your repayment plan</h3><p>With federal student loans, you may have multiple repayment plans to choose from, including income-driven repayment (IDR). These plans set your payments at a percentage of your income, and some borrowers may qualify for $0 monthly payments. After making the required payments for 20 or 25 years under IDR, any remaining loan balance can be forgiven. &nbsp;</p><p>These IDR plans include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Saving on a Valuable Education (<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">SAVE</a>) plan</li><li>Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Repayment plan</li><li>Income-Based Repayment (<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">IBR</a>) plan</li><li>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan</li></ul><p>Other options include Graduated Repayment, which sets your monthly payment lower at first before gradually increasing every two years. Borrowers with over $30,000 in debt could also use the Extended Repayment plan, which gives you 25 years to repay your loans with fixed or graduated payments.</p><p>Note that extending your repayment period often means you'll pay more in interest over the life of your loan. But by changing your plan, you could lower your monthly payments and make them more manageable. &nbsp;</p><h3>4. Explore consolidation or refinancing</h3><p>If you and your loan servicer haven’t been able to find a solution to your repayment hardship, thinking about federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/how-to-consolidate-student-loans\">student loan consolidation</a> can be a good next step.&nbsp;</p><p>To federally consolidate your debt, you must apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan. It's important to note that this won't reduce your interest rate, since it averages the rates on your current loans. However, consolidating your federal loans can combine them into one account, making it easier to manage. It can also extend your repayment period up to 30 years, lowering your monthly payments. &nbsp;</p><p>If lowering your rate is important, look into <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">refinancing student loans</a>. This involves taking out a new loan with a private lender that can offer a better rate, then using those proceeds to pay off your existing debt.&nbsp;</p><p>But before refinancing federal student loans, consider the pros and cons carefully. Doing so will forfeit your federal repayment protections, like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check Out:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/how-to-consolidate-student-loans\">How To Consolidate Student Loans</a>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Look into loan forgiveness</h3><p>Lastly, exploring <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">student loan forgiveness programs</a> could be the right option for you, especially if you work in public service. Although loan forgiveness is harder to qualify for than other options, it's a noteworthy opportunity for eligible borrowers. Several federal loan forgiveness programs exist, including <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> (PSLF) and Teacher Loan Forgiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, you could qualify for a type of loan forgiveness known as discharge under certain circumstances, such as if your school unexpectedly shuts down or you become totally and permanently disabled.</p><h2>If you can’t pay your private loans</h2><p>While federal student loans offer several ways to manage your debt during financial hardship, private student loans typically come with fewer options. However, that doesn't mean you're out of luck. Here are two potential solutions to consider:</p><h3>1. Contact your servicer as soon as possible</h3><p>If you can’t afford your private student loan payments, contact your lender or loan servicer as soon as possible — ideally, before you ever miss a payment. This way, you can work with them to find a solution. While exact policies vary, private lenders may be willing to temporarily pause your payments, reduce your payments for a short while, or offer a specialized repayment plan to help you catch up on missed payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that private lenders don’t offer the same loan protections as federal loans do, and they’ll generally be less forgiving of your missed payments.</p><h3>2. Refinance your private student loans</h3><p>Refinancing your loans can be a great option for getting back on track if your loan servicer doesn’t offer you helpful repayment options. Doing so could lower your interest rate and make your monthly loan payments more affordable.&nbsp;</p><p>However, you typically need excellent credit and a reliable income to qualify for the best refinancing rates. If you can't meet those requirements, adding a well-qualified <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner</a> to your application could help.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/how-to-refinance-student-loans\">how to refinance</a>, start by comparing interest rates and loan terms from multiple lenders.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTableByVertical:3158":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTableByVertical","id":"3158","ctaType":"forceSingleCta","lenders":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLendersByVertical","plLenders":[],"refiLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogLenderType","name":"RISLA","slug":"risla","variableRate":false,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"680","loanTerms":"5, 10, 15","loanAmount":"$7,500 - $250,000","discounts":"Yes,0.25% autopay discount","cosignerRelease":"Yes, after 24 months of consecutive on-time payments","repaymentOptions":"Academic deferment, income-based repayment, military deferment, forbearance, loans discharged upon death or disability","fees":"None","degrees":"Undergraduate & Graduate","vertical":"refi","lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/c1f17ab2-0014-49e9-b5ba-072b7a76e927","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.9,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/risla-review","bestFor":"Best for Income-Based Repayment","expertInsights":"<p>RISLA is notable among refinance lenders for its borrower-friendly repayment options.

The cost of a personal loan, for example, is usually expressed as an <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>, which accounts for the interest rate and any upfront fees. In general, a lower credit score means paying a higher APR. That’s why it’s crucial to compare APRs between the loans you’re considering to see which is the most affordable.</p><h3>Online lenders</h3><p>Several <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a> offer personal loans for bad credit. A personal loan provides a lump sum of cash that you repay in fixed monthly payments over several months or years. Some lenders, like Upstart, consider applicants with poor credit or no credit history, but most require a hard credit check when you apply. Others, like 60MonthLoans, only require a soft credit pull. Some online lenders, such as Oportun, OneMain, Upgrade, BestEgg, and Reprise, also offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\">secured loans</a> that may be easier to qualify for with bad credit.</p><p>Personal loans are generally much less costly and more manageable than no-credit-check options like payday loans. Plus, you can compare estimated rates from multiple lenders to find the best deal.</p><p>“The internet is a great equalizer in shopping and comparing loan terms and rates,” says Mark Williams, risk-management practitioner and master lecturer at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business. “With the proliferation of nonbank fintech lending companies, borrowers have many more options than payday loans to obtain competitive borrowing rates.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:8366":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"8366","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"personal-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:207330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"207330","content":"<h3>Banks</h3><p>While banks tend to have stricter eligibility criteria for loans than other financial institutions, some local banks may offer small loans to existing account holders without a credit check. These short-term loans have much lower APRs than payday loans.</p><p>For example, Bank of America offers a Balance Assist loan of up to $500 for a flat $5 fee (which translates to a maximum APR of 29.76%, depending on the amount you borrow). U.S. Bank offers its Simple Loan up to $1,000 with a low fixed rate for every $100 borrowed. Check your bank to see if a similar funding solution is available.</p><p><strong>Explore: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">Best Banks for Personal Loans</a></p><h3>Credit unions</h3><p>Federal credit unions are member-owned, not-for-profit financial institutions that often serve bad credit borrowers. They tend to charge lower rates and fees and have less stringent income and credit requirements than banks. Plus, they can also be a resource for financial education.</p><p>A credit union may offer a few different loan options, including personal loans and <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loans</a> (PALs I and II). You can borrow up to $2,000 with a PAL II loan and repay it in 12 months or less. PALs I offer loans up to $1,000 with maximum six-month repayment terms, but you’ll need to be a member for at least one month to qualify. PALs don’t typically require a credit check, and interest rates are capped at 28%.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p>Cash advance apps offer a small advance on your earned wages that typically gets repaid out of your next paycheck, often with no credit check required. Cash advance apps can help you cover a one-time, unexpected expense, but many charge subscription fees and express transfer fees that could equate to triple-digit APRs comparable to payday loans.</p><p>But it’s also possible to get a few hundred dollars without paying the high fees associated with payday loans. For example, MoneyLion offers an advance of up to $500 with no credit check, no subscription fees, no interest, and no transfer fees for regular transfers. Tipping is optional. Before using a cash advance app, make sure you understand the fees and take note of the overdraft risk.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">Payday Loans vs. Cash Advances</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:207334":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"207334","content":"<h3>Family loan or salary advance</h3><p>The least expensive way to borrow money when you have bad credit may be to ask your family or employer for help.

Interest rates are typically low, just to cover administrative costs, since employers generally aren’t allowed to earn money from offering loans to workers.</p><p>Likewise, someone in your family could offer you a low-interest or interest-free loan and provide some flexibility with repayment.

You can also use a loan platform like <a href=\"https://www.usepigeon.io/\">Pigeon</a> to facilitate a loan from a friend or family member.</p><h2>Bad credit loans to avoid</h2><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> are short-term, small-dollar loans that you repay out of your next paycheck. You can get a payday loan from a storefront or online payday lender with no credit check. But the fees could equate to over 400% APR depending on the laws in your state. In some states, payday loans are banned, or payday lenders don’t operate due to interest rate caps. “Payday loans are predatory and come with high interest rates, add-on fees, and unfriendly terms,” says Williams. “Such loans should be avoided at all costs.”</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loans-vs-personal-loans\">Payday Loans vs. Personal Loans</a></p><h3>Credit card cash advances</h3><p>Many credit card issuers allow short-term loans against your credit line, known as cash advances. You can get a cash advance from an ATM without needing to apply, so your credit score won’t be an obstacle. But cash advances often come with higher APRs than regular purchases. There is often no grace period before interest begins accruing, and you typically need to pay fees. It’s best to avoid credit card cash advances if you have other options.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>An <a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">auto title loan</a> is a lump sum loan secured by the title to your vehicle. You can continue to drive your car while you pay off the loan, but if you fail to repay by the due date, the lender can seize your car.</p><p>Title loans vary significantly from state to state due to variations in state laws. But title loans often come with high fees and require repayment within 30 days. For example, auto title lenders in Alabama may charge up to 300% APR. Many borrowers find repayment difficult because of the short repayment terms, and title lenders commonly offer the option to renew your loan, which can lead to even more fees.</p><h3>Pawnshop loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">Pawnshop loans</a> are short-term loans secured by a valuable item like gold jewelry or a television. The pawnbroker holds the item until you repay the loan and can sell the item if you fail to repay. The average pawnshop loan amount is $150 with a repayment window of about 30 days.</p><p>While interest rates vary by state, pawnshop loans can be costly. For example, pawnbrokers in Illinois can charge up to 20% per month, which equates to 243% APR.</p><p>One potential benefit of a pawnshop loan is that the lender generally can’t pursue you for collection if you fail to repay it. However, you’d lose the asset you put up as collateral.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-scams\">8 Signs of Personal Loan Scams</a></p><h2>How to qualify for a loan with bad credit</h2><ul><li><strong>Research bad credit lenders:</strong> Look for online lenders that offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit personal loans</a> and prequalify to compare potential APRs, repayment terms, and loan amounts to your other options.

Confirm what loan term works best for you</h2><p>Start by determining how much money you need and how long you'll need to repay it.

While practical for small amounts, these options may not be ideal if you need a larger loan or more time to repay.</p><p>For instance, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">personal loan term lengths</a> generally range from 1 to 7 years, though this varies by lender.

Review loan types and availability</h2><p>Once you've determined the repayment term you need, review the types of bad credit loans available:</p><h3>Short-term loans for bad credit</h3><ul><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> These allow you to access a portion of your paycheck early. Fees may apply, and repeated use can lead to a cycle of borrowing, as repayment comes directly from your next paycheck.</li><li><strong>BNPL programs:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">Buy now, pay later apps</a> split the cost of a purchase into smaller payments. Each program works differently, but a common structure is to make one payment at purchase and then three more within a given time period. Short-term repayments might be interest- and fee-free, but longer repayment periods may come with interest or fees.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> High-cost loans requiring repayment by your next paycheck.

Review eligibility requirements</h2><p>You might wonder <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">how much of a personal loan you can get</a> with your credit score — or if you can qualify at all? But a credit score only paints part of the picture. In addition to minimum credit score thresholds, lenders may have several other eligibility requirements for personal loans, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This is a measure of your monthly debt obligations compared to your monthly income. Lenders generally want to see a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income (DTI) ratio</a> of 36% or less, but some may accept slightly higher DTIs. If you're getting a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">personal loan to consolidate debt</a>, lenders may be more lax about this.</li><li><strong>Employment and income:</strong> Lenders want to know that you're able to make monthly payments. Proof of employment or a source of monthly income is thus a common requirement for a personal loan.</li><li><strong>Collateral or co-borrower:</strong> If you have bad credit, you may also need to get a secured loan by offering collateral; your house or car is <a href=\"/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">common collateral for a personal loan</a>. Alternatively, you may need a co-borrower with better credit to sign the loan with you.</li></ul><p>In addition, lenders typically have requirements regarding age and citizenship for personal loans.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:207926":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"207926","content":"<p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">What Are the Requirements for a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>4.

If a loan you're considering charges one, you may want to look elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Rate contingencies:</strong> Some lenders may offer a certain APR only if you sign up for autopay. If you're not comfortable using autopay (because of the risk of overdrafting your checking account), adjust your expectations for the rate or find a lender with a better offer.</li></ul><h2>How to apply for a bad credit personal loan</h2><p>Applying for a personal loan with bad credit is much like the process of applying for a personal loan with good credit. Your pool of options will just be smaller — and you'll likely face higher rates and fees.</p><ol><li><strong>Get a handle on your finances:</strong> Check your credit score, calculate your debt-to-income ratio, and figure out just how much you need to borrow. Knowing these parameters will help you filter your search to lenders that are likely to approve your application.</li><li><strong>Compare lenders:</strong> Using the steps we outlined above, <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">compare multiple lenders</a> to see which advertise the lowest rates and fees but also have a solid reputation with customers.</li><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong> Once you've narrowed down your list, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">get prequalified</a> with the remaining lenders. This should be a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score — and will help you determine which lender will give you the lowest rate and fees.</li><li><strong>Fill out the application:</strong> Online lenders make the application process easy, but you'll still need to find paperwork such as recent pay stubs or tax returns to get approved.

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Flexible eligibility requirements</li><li>Offers secured options</li><li>Competitive bad-credit loans</li><li>Physical presence</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Availability</li><li>Origination fees</li><li>High starting APR</li><li>Low maximum loan amount</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$1,500 to $20,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>Origination fee, unsuccessful payment fee, late fee</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Discounts</p><div><p>None</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must have photo I.D. issued by U.S. federal, state or local government</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Min. income</p><div><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Customer service</p><div><p>Phone, email</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Soft credit check</p><div><p>Yes</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Time to get funds</p><div><p>As soon as 1 to 2 days after acceptance</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan use</p><div><p>All except business, and education</p></div></div></div></div></div><a class="LenderTableMoreDetails_readFullReview__0Peup styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_semiBold__25tTb styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../onemain-financial-personal-loans-review.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read full review</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-32"><span class="neutral disclaimer">All APRs reflect autopay and loyalty discounts where available</span><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../legal-pages/pl-general-disclosures.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read more about Rates and Terms</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../terms.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Terms of Service</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../privacy.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Privacy Policy</a></div></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="-confirm-what-loan-term-works-best-for-you">1.

Some online lenders, such as Oportun, OneMain, Upgrade, BestEgg, and Reprise, also offer \u003ca href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\"\u003esecured loans\u003c/a\u003e that may be easier to qualify for with bad credit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonal loans are generally much less costly and more manageable than no-credit-check options like payday loans.
