              "text": "You have several options, even with bad credit. But some are much better than others.Personal loans for bad credit: Offered by some lenders specifically for borrowers with FICO scores below 580, bad credit loans have interest rates that are generally capped at 36% APR and can be used to pay for emergency expenses and debt consolidation.Secured loans: These require collateral, such as a car or savings account, which can make approval easier despite bad credit. Just note that the lender can take your collateral if you miss payments.Payday loans: Payday loans have short terms and very high fees, which result in exorbitant APRs. The CFPB reports that the typical 2-week payday loan has an APR just under 400%. They don't require a credit check, but will require a post-dated check or other means by which the lender can withdraw the amount due from your bank account.Title loans:&nbsp;Your vehicle's title is used as collateral. Like payday loans, title loans carry high risk, high APRs, and should be avoided if possible.Payday alternative loans: Federal credit unions may offer payday alternative loans (PALs) which are designed as an alternative to payday loans. They often don't involve a credit check and you may be able to borrow up to $2,000 with a repayment term of up to 12 months.Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans: These loans are funded by individual investors through online platforms. Credit requirements vary.Small bank loans: Some banks offer short-term funding solutions with low fees to existing customers up to $500 or $1,000.

Lenders who offer&nbsp;no-credit-check loans often base approval on your income, employment status, or collateral rather than your credit history.&nbsp;While this can be helpful if you have poor or no credit, it's important to be cautious. Loans like payday loans and title loans can be very expensive and risky. If you can't pay the loan back, you could get trapped in a cycle of ever-increasing debt (payday loans) or lose your car (title loans). Try to qualify for a loan with a credit check by finding lenders that offer loans for bad credit — before you sign for a payday loan, title loan, or other short-term, high fee loan."

                    We want this to be a “win-win” situation. So we only want to
                    get paid if we bring you value in the form of finding a
                    personal finance option that works for you. Not by selling
                    your data. Credible receives compensation when we help you
                    find the best product from one of our lending partners. The
                    amount of our compensation does not impact how and where
                    lenders appear on our site, and Credible charges you no fees
                    of any sort. Some lenders may take traffic sources into
                    account when offering credit terms.

                A personal loan is among your best borrowing options with bad
                credit, but qualifying can be tough. Expect high rates (above
                30% APR) and relatively low loan amounts (less than $5,000). If
                you can&#x27;t qualify, consider other options like debt
                management through a credit counselor.

                    If you have bad credit (a FICO score below 580) and can get
                    approved for a personal loan, you can expect an APR near or
                    above 30%. With good credit, your APR could be closer to the
                    15%-20% range.

                    Use the calculator below to get a sense of how much your
                    monthly loan payment could be. If you have bad credit, input
                    a rate of 30% or more. If the payment is too high, try
                    extending the loan term to lower it. Just keep in mind that
                    most lenders cap repayment terms at five or seven years.

                    history of how you&#x27;ve used credit and managed your
                    finances. Unfortunately, credit reports sometimes have
                    incorrect or outdated information that could make you seem
                    more risky to a lender.

                    2. Make credit payments on time
                  </h3>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    Your payment history is the most important factor in your
                    FICO score. It accounts for 35% of your overall score. If
                    you make payments to credit accounts on time every month,
                    you can gradually improve your credit score. But if your
                    record of making on-time payments is inconsistent, the
                    opposite can happen.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    In short, always make payments on time. One way to reduce
                    the risk of late payments is to set up auto-pay on your
                    accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    The types of credit accounts considered in your payment
                    history can include:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    <li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Credit cards</li>
                    <li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                      Retail accounts, such as department store credit cards
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                      Installment loans, such as personal loans and car loans
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Mortgages</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    Also, FICO has announced that it will incorporate &quot;Buy
                    Now, Pay Later&quot; (BNPL) purchases into its scoring
                    model. Some services, like Affirm, are already reporting new
                    plans to the bureaus. So get in the habit of paying off your
                    BNPL purchases on time.

                    3. Apply for a secured credit card
                  </h3>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    Secured credit cards are designed for people with low credit
                    scores or limited credit history. You make a cash security
                    deposit and then use the card as you would use an unsecured
                    credit card (which includes making your payments on time).
                    The deposit is typically refunded when you upgrade to an
                    unsecured card or close the account.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    Used responsibly, a secured credit card that reports to one
                    or more of the credit bureaus can help build your credit
                    over time. It can also provide a convenient alternative to
                    paying cash or worrying whether you have enough money in
                    your checking account to cover debit card purchases.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">
                    4. Become an authorized user on another person&#x27;s credit
                    card
                  </h3>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    If you have a parent, sibling, or close friend who uses
                    their credit card responsibly, you could benefit from their
                    good credit habits by becoming an authorized user on their
                    card. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    You don&#x27;t have to use the card yourself — and it&#x27;s
                    probably best that you and the primary cardholder agree that
                    you won&#x27;t. If the card issuer reports authorized user
                    data to the credit bureaus, the primary user&#x27;s payment
                    and purchase activity would also show up on your credit
                    report as well.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    However, the key is knowing a cardholder you can trust, and
                    vice versa. If you know someone who would be willing to
                    help, ask them about contacting the card issuer to add you
                    as an authorized user.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">
                    You can also try other credit-building strategies, including
                    paying down current debt to reduce your credit utilization.

                                  Payday loans have short terms and very high
                                  fees, which result in exorbitant APRs. The
                                  CFPB reports that the typical 2-week payday
                                  loan has an APR just under 400%. They
                                  don&#x27;t require a credit check, but will
                                  require a post-dated check or other means by
                                  which the lender can withdraw the amount due
                                  from your bank account.

                                Loans like payday loans and title loans can be
                                very expensive and risky. If you can&#x27;t pay
                                the loan back, you could get trapped in a cycle
                                of ever-increasing debt (payday loans) or lose
                                your car (title loans). Try to qualify for a
                                loan with a credit check by finding lenders that
                                offer loans for bad credit — before you sign for
                                a payday loan, title loan, or other short-term,
                                high fee loan.

                    directly with lenders to offer loans for a wide range of
                    credit profiles and loan purposes. Because of these
                    relationships, we have access to the most current interest
                    rates that real borrowers are being approved for, along with
                    average rates by credit score and loan purpose, approval
                    rates overall and by lender, and more. The data we use is
                    primary source data, updated weekly, and does not include
                    any personally identifiable information about borrowers.

But other loan types can be more cost-effective, especially if you can pay them off over a short period or if you’re willing and able to provide collateral. For instance:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredit cards:\u003c/strong\u003e Credit cards generally let you borrow interest-free for the span of one billing cycle (roughly 30 days), making them the go-to for very short-term borrowing. Many also provide longer 0% APR promotional periods if you can qualify — often between 12 and 21 months. If you’re confident you can pay off the amount you need within an interest-free period, that’s likely a better choice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHome equity loans and HELOCs:\u003c/strong\u003e If you own your home and have sufficient equity to qualify (often at least 15%), you could get a much lower interest rate with a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. However, you’re required to secure the loan with your home, which means it’s at risk if you can’t make payments. If you use a home equity loan or HELOC to make improvements to your home, you may be able to deduct the interest payments on your tax return.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eYou’ll apply for a mortgage within the year (with an exception)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnless you’re consolidating\u0026nbsp;credit card debt, it’s often best to avoid applying for any new credit before you apply for a mortgage. This is because when you apply for most loans, a hard credit pull is recorded on your credit report, which can drag your score down up to 10 points. In turn, this could increase the rate you get on a mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if you use an installment loan (and not another credit card) to consolidate credit card debt, you could substantially lower your credit utilization. This, in turn, could increase your credit score more than enough to offset the hard credit check. Another benefit is that you could potentially lower your monthly payment, thereby reducing your DTI (debt-to-income ratio) — which could help you get a lower rate or larger loan amount on a mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eYou want to consolidate debt, but can’t get a lower interest rate (with an exception)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, you should only replace one loan (or loans) with another if you can save money. So, if you can’t, it doesn’t make sense to. The exception is if you can’t afford to make your monthly payments. In that case, it could make sense to accept a higher interest rate with a longer repayment term to avoid credit damage from missing payments. You also might want to mix and match in this case — only consolidate your higher interest debts and keep the low-rate loans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e"

According to 12 months of \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-statistics\"\u003eCredible personal loans data\u003c/a\u003e, less than 1% of borrowers with bad credit were able to prequalify for a personal loan. So how are the bad-credit borrowers who do qualify able to? There are a few steps that can make a big difference:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#014452;\"\u003e1. Improve your credit score\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA FICO score closer to 580-669 (fair credit) could make you eligible for a loan with more lenders. For instance, OneMainFinancial requires a minimum FICO score of 540, while Reprise requires a minimum 550 FICO score. And if you can breach the fair credit boundary, you could be eligible for a loan with lenders such as Avant, Universal Credit, and Upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart by checking your credit report for errors — if a paid account has been misreported, for example, file a dispute with the bureau reporting the error. Otherwise, practice good credit habits by paying debts on time and keeping your credit utilization low. On-time payments can lead to score improvements within six months.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#014452;\"\u003e2. Reduce your debt-to-income ratio\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may seem counterintuitive, but if there’s a way for you to pay down debt before you apply for a loan, you could improve your chances of qualifying. Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) represents the percentage of your income that goes toward debt — add up all your minimum monthly debt payments and divide that by your total monthly income (before taxes). The lower your DTI, the better. A DTI above 50% could be a red flag that might lead to a loan denial, especially if paired with bad credit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#014452;\"\u003e3.

They have equal access to the loan funds and share responsibility for repayment. You might take out a joint personal loan with your spouse, for example, to finance home repairs or improvements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\"\u003eLenders that allow cosigners\u003c/a\u003e on loans are not common, but a few exist. \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan\"\u003eJoint loans\u003c/a\u003e, however, are more widely available.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

Unfortunately, credit reports sometimes have incorrect or outdated information that could make you seem more risky to a lender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet free copies of your credit reports from all three major credit bureaus at\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\"\u003eAnnualCreditReport.com\u003c/a\u003e. Check each report for inaccuracies — for example, a debt you've already repaid but is still listed as outstanding. If you see anything that looks incorrect, follow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's step-by-step guide on\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/\"\u003ehow to dispute information on your credit report\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Make credit payments on time\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour payment history is the most important factor in your FICO score. It accounts for 35% of your overall score. If you make payments to credit accounts on time every month, you can gradually improve your credit score. But if your record of making on-time payments is inconsistent, the opposite can happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, always make payments on time. One way to reduce the risk of late payments is to set up auto-pay on your accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe types of credit accounts considered in your payment history can include:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCredit cards\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRetail accounts, such as department store credit cards\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstallment loans, such as personal loans and car loans\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMortgages\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, FICO has announced that it will incorporate \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" (BNPL) purchases into its scoring model. Some services, like Affirm, are already reporting new plans to the bureaus. So get in the habit of paying off your BNPL purchases on time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3. Apply for a secured credit card\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecured credit cards are designed for people with low credit scores or limited credit history. You make a cash security deposit and then use the card as you would use an unsecured credit card (which includes making your payments on time). The deposit is typically refunded when you upgrade to an unsecured card or close the account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsed responsibly, a secured credit card that reports to one or more of the credit bureaus can help build your credit over time. It can also provide a convenient alternative to paying cash or worrying whether you have enough money in your checking account to cover debit card purchases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e4. Become an authorized user on another person's credit card\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have a parent, sibling, or close friend who uses their credit card responsibly, you could benefit from their good credit habits by becoming an authorized user on their card.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don't have to use the card yourself — and it's probably best that you and the primary cardholder agree that you won't. If the card issuer reports authorized user data to the credit bureaus, the primary user's payment and purchase activity would also show up on your credit report as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the key is knowing a cardholder you can trust, and vice versa. If you know someone who would be willing to help, ask them about contacting the card issuer to add you as an authorized user.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also try other credit-building strategies, including paying down current debt to reduce your credit utilization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRead more tips in\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\"\u003eHow To Build Your Credit: A Step-by-Step Guide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e"

You'll have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher. The primary applicant has to meet both income and FICO requirements, the co-applicant only has to meet the income requirements.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLoan amounts start at $20,000, so look elsewhere for small loans.

Loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating — indicating generally satisfied customers. \n\nBut Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are relatively low at $25,000, and the minimum repayment term is relatively high at three years. The lender also charges origination fees, does not offer discounts, does not consider income from self-employment, and is not available nationwide. ",

Make credit payments on time\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour payment history is the most important factor in your FICO score. It accounts for 35% of your overall score. If you make payments to credit accounts on time every month, you can gradually improve your credit score. But if your record of making on-time payments is inconsistent, the opposite can happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, always make payments on time.

Apply for a secured credit card\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecured credit cards are designed for people with low credit scores or limited credit history.
