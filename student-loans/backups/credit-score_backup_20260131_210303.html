With private student loans, most lenders want you to have a credit score of around 670 or higher. Keep in mind that the minimum credit score can vary depending on the lender. If you don't have great credit, you'll probably need a cosigner to get approved.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score do I need for a federal student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Your credit score isn't a factor for federal student loans. However, your credit history is a factor for Direct PLUS Loans. You can't qualify for a PLUS loan with an adverse credit history, which includes a recent history of default determinations, property foreclosures, or tax liens, among other serious credit issues. If you add an endorser to your application or you can prove you had extenuating circumstances, you may still be able to take out a PLUS loan.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score do I need for a private student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Each private lender has its own credit score criteria. However, you'll generally need a FICO score of 670 or higher to qualify for a private student loan. The best rates are reserved for those with the highest credit scores.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a cosigner for a private student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>While a cosigner isn't required for private student loans, you likely won't qualify without one if you have no credit, poor credit, or little to no credit history. Adding a cosigner with excellent credit and a steady income to your application can improve your approval odds and help you qualify for a lower interest rate.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I improve my credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You can boost your credit score by making payments on your debts on time, disputing any inaccuracies in your credit report with the appropriate bureau, becoming an authorized user on a loved one's credit card, or getting a secured credit card and keeping up with payments.</p>"}}]}

It can give you an idea of the interest rate you could get, along with how much you might qualify to borrow, and what repayment terms are likely available to you — in only a few minutes and it doesn't hurt your credit. But not everyone can prequalify for a loan. For instance, some lenders have high minimum credit score or income requirements that might make you ineligible for a loan with them.&nbsp;</p><p>With Upstart, more people were able to prequalify relative to all other lenders on the Credible personal loan marketplace. A prequalification quote can give you a basis by which to compare potential loans and loan options &nbsp;— especially if you're deciding between using a credit card with a high APR or a personal loan.

So if you have a 30-year mortgage, you could make additional principal payments monthly to pay off the loan faster — potentially trimming years off your loan and saving thousands of dollars in interest. If you can't afford a higher monthly payment, you could direct cash windfalls, like tax refunds and bonuses, to accomplish the same thing. Just check with your lender first to make sure no prepayment penalty applies.”&nbsp;</p><p><i>— Meredith Mangan, Senior Loans Editor,

You can divide the monthly payment by 28% to see what the monthly income should be ($2,697.98/0.28 = $9,635.64).

You can use a mortgage calculator to see what interest rates and terms could result in a payment that falls within 28% of your gross monthly income. For example, with a salary of $100,000, you’d calculate your monthly pre-tax income ($100,000/12 = $8,333.33). Then, multiply that by 28% to determine an affordable monthly payment ($8,333.33 x 0.28 = $2,333.33). For your payments to be affordable, it would be best not to exceed $2,333.33, depending on your other debts.

You can also talk to lenders about paying <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-are-mortgage-points\">mortgage points</a>, which could lower your interest rate (for a fee).</li><li><strong>Negotiate your home purchase:</strong> Use your pre-approval letter to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-much-to-offer-on-a-house\">make an offer on a house</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/negotiating-closing-costs\">negotiate the purchase details</a>. If you’re working with a real estate agent, they can help guide you through the process.</li><li><strong>Complete your mortgage application: </strong>After the seller has accepted your offer, fill out your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage\">lender’s full application.</a> This requires more detailed information than your pre-approval did. Be prepared to provide documents like tax returns, W-2s, and bank statements.</li><li><strong>Wait for full approval: </strong>Your loan will move into underwriting, which means your application is evaluated, your income is verified, and all the numbers are crunched. The lender will also request a home appraisal to ensure it’s worth the money you’re looking to borrow for it.</li><li><strong>Prep for closing: </strong>Once you get your closing date, you’ll need to arrange for homeowners insurance because your lender will likely require it. You should also take some time to review your closing disclosures to make sure you understand the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cost-to-buy-house\">final costs</a> and terms of your loan.</li><li><strong>Close on your loan:</strong> Finally, you’ll attend your closing appointment, sign your paperwork, and pay your closing costs.

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

To keep costs down, avoid tipping and paying extra for instant money, if possible.

If you get cash advances frequently, these fees can add up.</li><li><strong>More expensive than personal loans:</strong> While advances from a cash advance app are easier to get than <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, they tend to be more expensive.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

But in addition to the FICO scoring model, there's the less-used VantageScore.</p><p>Several factors affect your credit scores, each to a different extent. FICO calculates scores based on these primary factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Payment history: </strong>This shows lenders your record of repaying debts and accounts for 35% of your score.</li><li><strong>Amounts owed:</strong> This metric considers the amount you owe across all your accounts. It includes the amount of revolving credit you use and accounts for 30% of your score.</li><li><strong>Length of credit history: </strong>This accounts for how long you've had credit accounts, going back to your oldest account.

Not all lenders and creditors report to all credit bureaus; they don't necessarily run hard credit checks with each bureau when you apply for credit either. As a result, your scores can, and often do, differ.</p><p>It's a good idea to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-to-check-credit-score\">check your credit scores</a> regularly.</p><h2>What is the minimum credit score needed for a personal loan?</h2><p>Minimum credit score requirements for personal loans vary by lender, but many require good credit, which is a FICO score of 670 or higher. However, there are quite a few lenders — like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/upstart-personal-loans-review\">Upstart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/reprise-personal-loans-review\">Reprise</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/universal-credit-personal-loans-review\">Universal Credit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-egg-personal-loans-review\">Best Egg</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/avant-personal-loans-review\">Avant</a> — that offer loans for fair credit or bad credit.

However, the impact is small — likely a drop of only a few points. However, some could drop by up to 10 points for up to one year.</p><p>However, new credit may have a positive impact on your credit score over time. If a personal loan improves your credit mix, your score can rise. Similarly, if you make consistent on-time payments, your positive payment history will help improve your score. Both those factors might take six months or more to positively impact your score.</p><p>However, if you use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">personal loan to consolidate credit card debt</a>, you could see a substantial gain in your credit score within one month. That's because by paying off your cards with an installment loan, you'll free up revolving credit. This will, in turn, increase your available credit — which can contribute up to 30% to your score. Since credit card companies typically report to the bureaus monthly, you could see relatively quick credit score gains.</p><h2>Tips for building credit</h2><p>If you don't need to borrow money right away, taking time to build your credit can help you qualify for better loan terms. “To increase their creditworthiness, applicants should be deliberate about improving their credit profile and trustworthiness,” says Derrick Creighton Jr., Financial Wellness Coach at BrightUp. “Several months before applying for credit, applicants should attempt to pay down debts, remove inaccuracies on their credit report, and limit credit usage.”</p><p>Here's a breakdown of how to do just that:</p><ul><li><strong>Make every payment on time: </strong>Payment history is the largest factor affecting your credit score, so missed payments can be detrimental. Keep all payment due dates in your calendar, or better yet, sign up for automatic payments. Just don't rely on autopay and forget about it — if it fails to send on time, you're still on the hook for the late payment.</li><li><strong>Limit your credit utilization: </strong>Your credit utilization is the percentage of available credit you use. Lenders don't like to see you maxing out your credit accounts, so keep utilization low when possible — ideally less than 30%. This may mean putting fewer purchases on your credit cards or requesting a credit line increase.</li><li><strong>Keep old accounts open: </strong>Closing out an old credit card you no longer use may sound like a good idea, but think twice. The older your credit “age,” the better it is for your credit score. Keeping old accounts open — even if you don't use them — can help your score.</li><li><strong>Check your credit report regularly: </strong>Your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-report\">credit report</a> is a collection of your credit activity, accounts, and payment history. Creditors submit information to credit reporting companies, but errors happen. Check your credit report for free at <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> and review it for any mistakes. If you find any, dispute them with the credit reporting agencies. Your credit report doesn't contain your score, but you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">check your credit score for free</a> with Credible's credit-monitoring tool.</li></ul><h2>Other personal loan requirements</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Personal loan requirements</a> vary by lender. But most lenders tend to consider the same basic factors in addition to your credit score:</p><ul><li><strong>Income: </strong>Lenders want to be sure you have the funds to repay your loan, so they may have minimum income requirements. These requirements vary by lender: For example, Discover requires an annual income of $25,000, while Upstart requires $12,000. Generally, the higher your income, the more money you can borrow.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI): </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward repaying your debt. The higher your DTI, the less room you have in your budget, and the less likely you are to qualify for a loan. Lenders typically like to see a DTI of no more than 36%.</li><li><strong>Collateral: </strong>Some lenders, like Best Egg, allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secure your personal loan</a> with an asset. If you can't repay your loan, the lender can seize your collateral. While this can be risky as a borrower, it can also help you get approved for a loan.</li><li><strong>Other general requirements: </strong>Most lenders have additional requirements, such as age and residency requirements. You often have to be at least 18 years old, be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, submit proof of address, and provide your Social Security or Taxpayer Identification Number.</li></ul><h2>Alternatives to personal loans</h2><p>Getting a personal loan is a big financial commitment and isn't always the most affordable, convenient, or practical way to borrow. If you want to explore other options, consider these <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-alternatives\">personal loan alternatives</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Credit cards: </strong>Credit cards typically have higher interest rates than personal loans, and are best used for purchases you can pay off within one month (before interest charges kick in). But if you can get a card with a 0% APR introductory APR and pay off your balance before the rate increases, you could borrow interest-free for 15 to 24 months.</li><li><strong>Home equity loans or HELOCs: </strong>Home equity products let you borrow against the equity you have in your home and typically have lower interest rates compared to personal loans. But the approval period can take weeks or more, closing costs may be higher, and you'll need to put your home up as collateral for the loan.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>: </strong>For smaller loan amounts, consider a PAL from a credit union. These short-term loans allow credit union members to borrow as much as $2,000 and have an interest rate cap of 28%.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps: </strong>Cash advance apps, or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\">loan apps</a>, let you borrow money against your future paycheck. They may charge instant pay or subscription fees that can lead to ultra-high APRs.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\"><strong>Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)</strong></a><strong>: </strong>BNPL services allow you to make a purchase in several payments, often spaced two weeks or one month apart. Short-term BNPL plans typically don't come with interest but may charge late fees. Longer-term plans may also be interest-free, depending on the store you're purchasing from and your credit.</li><li><strong>Financial assistance: </strong>If you're struggling to keep up with essential expenses, don't overlook financial assistance programs that can help you with food, housing, medical care, utility bills, and more. Visit <a href=\"https://211.org/\">211.org</a> to learn about resources available in your area.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324562":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324562","content":"<h2>Our take on Reprise</h2><p>Reprise Financial (4.2 out of 5 stars) is the highest-rated Credible lending partner that considers bad-credit borrowers, and the main reason is its comparatively low interest rates.

Loans are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to 1 year.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\"><strong>Credit builder loan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you can wait for the money, a credit builder loan can be an effective way to improve your credit or build a credit history. A credit builder loan works in reverse. Instead of getting the loan proceeds upfront, you get the money after you’ve finished paying off the loan. Rates are typically well below 10% and loan terms often last up to two years (but can be shorter).</li><li><strong>Small bank loan:</strong> Some banks like U.S. Bank and Bank of America offer small loans (under or up to $1,000) to existing customers. Loans may not require a credit check and are typically paid back over a few monthly installments. Rates tend to be much lower than other small loan options.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Friends and family loan:</strong> If you’re already going to ask someone to cosign a loan for you, consider whether it makes sense for you to borrow from them instead. They could potentially benefit from interest income from you and from helping you out. Although you’d likely benefit from a much lower interest rate and better terms, note that loan payments wouldn’t be reported to the credit bureaus, so a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/family-loans\">friend or family loan</a> won’t improve your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>401(k) loan:</strong> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/401k-loan\">401(k) loan</a> is a way to borrow money from your retirement account — up to $50,000 or half of your vested balance, whichever is less. (If half your vested balance is less than $10,000, you may be able to borrow up to $10,000.) 401(k) loans don’t require a credit check and have low rates. Plus, the interest you pay goes into your account. However, they can be risky. The money you borrow will not be invested during the term of your loan, which could mean a significant loss of growth. Plus, if you can’t pay the loan back, it will be treated as a withdrawal, subject to income tax and early withdrawal penalties. Not all 401(k) plans allow loans.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:315214":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"315214","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best personal loans with cosigners.

That includes buy now, pay later (BNPL) agreements, store-branded and 0% APR promotional credit cards, furniture store loans offered by partner lenders, home equity loans, and other options that we'll cover later in this guide.</p><p>A personal loan for furniture is a type of installment loan that provides a lump sum of cash in exchange for equal monthly payments over several months or years. Rates on personal loans typically range from 6.49% APR to 35.99% APR.</p><p>Personal loan lenders typically require a credit check and proof of income. You can apply for a personal loan from an online lender, bank, or credit union and receive the money quickly, typically within a few business days.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252866":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252866","content":"<h2>How to compare personal loans for furniture</h2><p>As you research <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loans</a>, pay attention to the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Make sure the lender offers the amount you need. Some lenders require you to borrow a minimum of $5,000, while a few others may cap loan amounts at $10,000. Determine the total cost of the furniture you plan to buy, including tax, and your budget for repayment before choosing a lender.</li><li><strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong> Some lenders have more stringent requirements than others. Know your credit score before applying with any lender and, if possible, make sure you meet that lender's minimum credit score requirement. For example, LendingClub requires a minimum 660 FICO score for personal loans through Credible. You can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">check your credit score for free</a> with Credible's credit-monitoring tool.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> If you're taking out a large loan or have a tight budget, you might want a lender that offers extended repayment terms. For example, LightStream offers home improvement loans with repayment terms of up to 20 years that you can use to buy furniture. A longer repayment term lowers your monthly payment and gives you more time to repay, but you'll also pay more in interest over time. Shorter repayment terms are less costly.</li><li><strong>APR range:</strong> Most lenders advertise a range of annual percentage rates (APR), which tells you the annual cost of the loan as a percentage of the loan amount, including the interest rate and any upfront fees. But just because a lender has a low starting APR, doesn't mean you'll qualify for it. Generally, you need very good to excellent credit to qualify for a lender's lowest advertised APR.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Many personal loans come with an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a>, which is an upfront fee that often comes out of the loan funds. Most lenders also charge incidental fees, like late fees and returned check fees, though a few lenders like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/discover-personal-loans-review\">Discover</a> don't charge any fees.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Total cost: </strong>Personal loans with low APRs and short repayment terms generally cost the least, but it's important to ensure you can afford the monthly payment. Evaluate your budget and compare the total repayment cost of the loan options you're considering along with the monthly payment — you can also use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to compare loan costs and payments at different interest rates and repayment terms.</li><li><strong>Lender reputation: </strong>Evaluate the lender's reputation for customer service by reading customer reviews on third-party websites like Trustpilot, along with customer studies like <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study\">J.D. Power's 2025 Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study</a>.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252890":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252890","content":"<h2>Pros and cons of furniture personal loans</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252894":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252894","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Fixed repayment schedule: </strong>Since interest rates are fixed on personal loans, so are payments, unlike most credit cards and lines of credit.</li><li><strong>Lower APRs than credit cards, on average: </strong>A 2-year personal loan has an 11.57% APR on average, compared to 21.16% APR for the average credit card, according to the Federal Reserve.</li><li><strong>Quick funding: </strong>Unlike home equity financing, personal loans don't require a home appraisal or a lengthy underwriting process. Some lenders can issue the funds as soon as the same day you're approved.</li><li><strong>No collateral required: </strong>Most personal loans are unsecured, which means you don't need equity in your home or another valuable asset to offer as collateral.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>May be inaccessible if you have bad credit: </strong>Most personal loan borrowers have fair credit or better (a FICO score of at least 580). If you do get approved with bad credit, expect an APR above 30%.</li><li><strong>More expensive than short-term financing options:</strong> Some furniture financing options are interest-free, provided you can repay the full balance within one to two years. You might find these through an introductory APR on a new credit card, some BNPL plans, or store financing.</li><li><strong>Adds to your debt: </strong>Taking out a personal loan adds to your outstanding debt. This can affect your credit score, leave less wiggle room in your budget, and make it more difficult to save for the future.</li></ul><h2>How to get a personal loan for furniture</h2><p>Lenders may differ slightly, but most have a similar process for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">applying for a personal loan</a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong> Choose a few lenders that allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify</a> without damaging your credit. You can do this for free with multiple lenders at once through Credible. This process will provide you with an estimate of the APR and one or more repayment terms you might qualify for.</li><li><strong>Compare options: </strong>Compare prequalification quotes to choose the best loan option that meets your needs.</li><li><strong>Formally apply: </strong>Proceed with the formal application, answering additional questions and uploading required documents that prove your income and identity. Most lenders run a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/hard-credit-inquiry-get-rates-without-affecting-your-credit-score\">hard credit inquiry</a> at this stage, which may cause your credit score to dip temporarily.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Review and sign: </strong>If approved, read the terms and conditions carefully, checking the rate, fees, repayment term, and monthly payment. If everything looks good, e-sign your loan documents to initiate funding.</li><li><strong>Get your cash: </strong>The lender will transfer the funds to your bank account within a few days or as soon as the same day, in some cases.</li></ol><h3>How to get a personal loan for furniture with bad credit</h3><p>Getting a personal loan with bad credit can be a challenge, but there are a few strategies that might help:</p><ul><li><strong>Research </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><strong>bad credit lenders</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Some lenders have lower minimum credit score requirements than others. For example, Avant considers applicants with a credit score as low as 550 and OneMain Financial has no minimum credit score requirement.</li><li><strong>Look for secured personal loans: </strong>It may be easier to qualify for a personal loan if you offer collateral, or a valuable asset. Collateral reduces the lender's risk since the lender can take the asset if you fail to repay. For example, Oportun and OneMain Financial offer personal loans secured by the title to your car and may accept borrowers with bad credit.</li><li><strong>Apply with a cosigner or co-borrower:</strong> If you have a friend or family member with good credit, you could ask them to guarantee payment of the loan as a cosigner or co-applicant, which might help you qualify. A few <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">lenders allow cosigners</a>, and many allow co-borrowers — the difference is that a cosigner merely guarantees the loan, while a co-borrower has equal access to the funds.</li><li><strong>Improve your credit: </strong>If you can wait to buy furniture, make an effort to pay down debt and pay your monthly bills on time to improve your credit score. You could also try a credit improvement tool like <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/credit/score-boost/\">Experian Boost</a>.</li></ul><h2>Other financing options for new furniture</h2><p>Depending on your financial situation and the furniture you plan to buy, a personal loan might not be optimal for your needs. Consider the following alternatives.</p><h3>In-store financing and store-branded credit cards</h3><p>Some furniture stores offer financing options like installment loans or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/appliance-financing\">lease-to-own contracts</a>, typically through a third-party lender or leasing company. These options sometimes include unique features you won't find from a direct lender. For example, Bob's Discount Furniture offers a few options through its leasing and lending partners that don't require a credit score.</p><p>Many furniture retailers also offer deferred interest promotions when you apply for a store-branded credit card. This might be a good option if you plan to buy all your furniture from the same store and you're confident you can pay the balance in full within the promotional period. For example, the Wayfair credit card allows you to avoid interest for up to 24 months on purchases of $2,999 or more. But if you're unable to pay off the balance within that time frame, you'll be charged interest from the date of purchase at a high variable APR. Deferred financing promotions are common and typically have higher minimum purchase amounts for longer deferred interest periods.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252874":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252874","content":"<h3>0% APR credit card</h3><p>Some credit card issuers offer a 0% APR promotional period for new cardholders. Unlike store credit cards, issuers like Wells Fargo and Chase allow you to buy furniture at any retailer that accepts that card brand, and you can avoid interest for up to 21 months. These promotions are typically zero-interest promotions rather than deferred interest promotions. This means you won't be charged interest on the full amount if you don't pay it off within the promotional period. Instead, interest starts accruing at the end of the promotional period and only on the remaining amount you owe.</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies like Klarna and Affirm provide point-of-sale financing at many furniture retailers. You apply at checkout, the store fulfills your order, and you repay the BNPL provider. BNPL options have expanded: it used to be that you'd have to pay back the loan in four biweekly installments, including an upfront payment, to avoid interest. But you might qualify for a longer interest-free repayment term — like 12 months — depending on the provider and your credit.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252898","content":"<p>Most BNPL providers won't run a hard credit check to see if you're eligible for short-term financing, but may run one if you need a years-long repayment term. Also, they previously haven't reported payments (or non-payments) to the major credit bureaus. But credit reporting rules are changing soon for BNPL plans. “FICO intends to factor BNPL loans into credit scores starting this fall,” says Lana Wear, founder and CEO at HomeWear Designs. “This means that bad BNPL repayment behavior will negatively impact your credit score.”</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A home equity loan is secured by your home equity, or the share of your home that you own outright. Home equity loans require closing costs, can take weeks to close, and nonpayment can lead to foreclosure. But they could be a good option for very large furniture purchases, since they typically have lower APRs than personal loans.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:252902":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"252902","content":"<h3>HELOC</h3><p>A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is similar to a home equity loan — it uses your home as collateral. The difference is that you can draw against your credit line on an ongoing basis and only pay interest on the funds you use. A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/heloc?source=global-nav\">HELOC</a> can be helpful if you're furnishing your home little by little or you don't know how much you're going to spend.</p><h3>Personal line of credit</h3><p>Some banks and credit unions offer their customers a personal line of credit (PLOC), which is similar to a HELOC except that it's unsecured. A PLOC could have a higher APR than a personal loan, depending on your credit, but can be a good option if you plan to furnish your home in phases.</p><h3>Savings</h3><p>If your budget is tight, saving for your furniture purchase might be the best option. “If the purchase would strain your finances or you won't be able to pay a loan back per the terms of the agreement, wait,” says Wear. “It can actually be fun to build your space gradually — layers built over time give your home character and charm.” Some furniture stores also offer layaway programs that encourage you to deposit money in a dedicated savings account.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:308734":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"308734","content":"<p>If you need some cash, a personal loan can be a flexible, fast, and low-cost borrowing option.

You can get a PLOC from a bank or credit union.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity line of credit</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">home equity line of credit</a> (HELOC) allows you to borrow against the equity in your home on an ongoing basis, similar to a PLOC, except a HELOC is secured by your home. Since your home serves as collateral for a HELOC, lenders typically offer lower APRs than you would get with a PLOC. Depending on the structure of the HELOC, you may also enjoy a lengthy draw period during which you only need to make interest payments. But there’s a risk of foreclosure if you fail to repay.&nbsp;</p><h3>Home equity loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/best-home-equity-loan-lenders\">home equity loan</a> lets you borrow against the equity you've built up in your home and provides a lump sum that you repay in fixed monthly installments over time. Home equity loans may come with longer repayment terms than personal loans — up to 30 years — and may also come with lower APRs than personal loans. But since your home serves as collateral, too many missed payments may result in foreclosure. Home equity loans also require upfront fees, and it can take time to close the loan.&nbsp;</p><h3>401(k) loan</h3><p>Borrowing from your retirement account can disrupt your progress toward your savings goals, but a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/401k-loan-vs-personal-loan\">401(k) loan</a> doesn’t require a credit check or impact your credit score. As long as you repay the full balance to your account with interest by making at least quarterly payments, you won’t pay a tax penalty. Plans may allow up to five years for repayment. You shouldn’t borrow from your 401(k) if you think you’ll leave your current job before the, since your plan may require full repayment at once.&nbsp;</p><h3>Credit card</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/credit-card\">Credit cards</a> are a good option for smaller or recurring expenses. If you can qualify for a 0% APR promotion on a new credit card, you can also use a credit card for a large purchase or debt consolidation. Provided you keep up with the minimum payments, you can avoid interest for up to two years. Just keep in mind that balance transfers often carry a 3% to 5% balance transfer fee, and average&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\">credit card APRs</a> are high outside of zero-interest promotions. Make sure to pay the full balance on time to avoid losing a promotional rate and to avoid a penalty APR and fees.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:282726":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"282726","content":"<p>Whether you’re waiting for disability payments to kick in or facing an unexpected expense on a fixed income, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> can be a lifeline.

Look for lenders with no <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">credit score minimum</a> (or a low credit score minimum) and prequalify to get a sense of whether you’ll be approved, for how much, and at what rate. Unsecured loans don’t require collateral and can be funded within days. But you’ll usually need to authorize a hard credit inquiry when you apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to find an unsecured loan and rates:</strong>&nbsp;Look online for lenders willing to work with borrowers with bad credit and with no credit history. Rates on personal loans are typically capped at 36% on the high end. Bad-credit borrowers tend to get approved for rates above 30%, according to Credible data.</p><h3>Secured loan</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured personal loan</a> requires collateral, such as your savings account or a car. Because the lender can recover the collateral if you default, lenders are more willing to approve applicants with no credit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to find a secured loan and rates:</strong> Lenders such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/reprise-personal-loans-review\">Reprise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a> offer personal loans you can secure with your vehicle. If you’re a credit union member, see if your CU offers savings-secured loans. You could get a very low rate (below 10% APR) on a personal loan if it does, though your savings account would be used as collateral for the loan (so don’t default).&nbsp;</p><h3>Credit-builder loan</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">credit-builder loan</a> is a small loan specifically designed to help you build credit. Instead of receiving the loan upfront, the funds are held in a secure account while you make monthly payments. Your on-time payments are reported to the credit bureaus, thereby improving your credit history and score. Once the loan is paid off, the funds are released to you.</p><p><strong>Where to find a credit-builder loan and rates:</strong> Credit-builder loans aren't as common as personal loans, but some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">banks</a> offer them. Depending on the lender, rates may range from around 5% to 16% or more.</p><h3>401(k) loan</h3><p>A 401(k) loan lets you access money that’s in your 401(k) account without having to pay taxes or an early withdrawal penalty. The catch is you have to put it back into the account via regular (at least quarterly) installments, plus interest. The interest you pay also goes into your account.&nbsp;</p><p>If your plan allows 401(k) loans, you can borrow up to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is greater. If 50% of your vested account balance is less than $10,000, you can borrow up to $10,000. There’s no credit check with a 401(k) loan, which makes them a good option if you need money with no credit history.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313558":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313558","content":"<p><strong>Where to find a 401(k) loan and rates:</strong>&nbsp;Check with HR to see if your plan allows 401(k) loans. The rate on a 401(k) loan is typically the prime rate plus 1% to 2%. The prime rate is currently 7.25%; an 8.25% or 9.25% interest rate on a loan is likely much lower than what you’d be eligible for with a traditional lender.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:313562":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"313562","content":"<h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loans</a> are available from some federal credit unions. There’s often no credit check, and loan amounts are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to 1 year. Since credit unions generally report payments to the credit bureaus, a PAL can help you establish a good credit score and history.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to find a PAL and rates:</strong>&nbsp;PALs are exclusively available from credit unions, and APRs are capped at 28%. If you need a small loan and are (or can become) a member of a credit union that offers PALs, this can be a great way to borrow money and improve your credit.</p><h3>Small bank loan</h3><p>Some banks offer small, short-term loans to existing customers without a credit check. For instance, Bank of America offers small loans up to $500 for a flat $5 fee; the loan is repaid over three months. U.S. Bank offers loans up to $1,000 to existing customers, also with a three-month repayment term. Your bank may or may not report repayment to the credit bureaus.</p><p><strong>Where to find a small bank loan and rates:</strong>&nbsp;Check with your bank (or credit union) to see if it offers small, short-term loans. Each bank works differently, but it’s likely you’ll be charged a fee to borrow, as opposed to an interest rate. Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">short-term loan calculator</a> to make sure the fee is reasonable for the term of the loan.&nbsp;</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">Buy now, pay later (BNPL)</a> is a way to pay for online purchases over time. BNPL providers typically offer multiple repayment options, including an interest-free option that requires a down payment at checkout plus three additional bi-weekly installments. Longer-term installment plans may also available be available at a 0% APR or at a higher interest rate, depending on promotional offers.</p><p>Most BNPL providers perform a soft credit check when you sign up — which won't hurt your credit score — and may not require that you even have a credit history. BNPL can be a good option for online purchases you can repay quickly, but if you need more than six weeks for repayment, look for 0% offers or alternatives.</p><p><strong>Where to find BNPL and rates</strong>: BNPL options, such as Klarna, Afterpay, and Sezzle, are available at hundreds of thousands of online retailers. You’ll see the option to apply at checkout. Some BNPL providers also offer in-store payment options. APRs range from 0% for “Pay-in-4” options to 36% for longer-term installment plans.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cash apps</h3><p>Cash advance apps, also known as earned wage advance or paycheck advance apps, offer a way to access your paycheck ahead of payday. Rates, terms, and fees for these arrangements vary widely from one app to the next — some charge monthly subscription fees and/or high \"instant\" transfer fees and tips, and can lead to potential overdraft fees. These seemingly low-cost, short-term loans can actually be quite high-cost. The Center for Responsible Lending found that the <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/not-free-large-hidden-costs-small-dollar-loans-made-through-cash-advance-apps\">average cash app APR was 367%</a>.</p><p>Cash advance apps typically don’t require a credit check, but you'll need to link a bank account that receives income, and the agreement may require automatic repayment from your next paycheck. You can only receive a few hundred dollars at a time, and first-time limits are often even lower. While these may be an option in a pinch, they can create a need for repeat borrowing (much like payday loans), and are generally not recommended.</p><p><strong>Where to find a cash app and rates</strong>: Some <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\">loan apps</a> are better than others. Start by checking if your employer works with a provider like PayActiv. Rates and fees vary significantly, so make sure to read the terms carefully — especially when it comes to charges for same-day cash.&nbsp;</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">car title loan</a> is typically a no-credit-check loan secured by the title to your vehicle, meaning the lender can take your car if you don’t repay according to the loan's terms. Title loan rates and repayment terms vary significantly from one state to the next due to variations in consumer protection laws, and some title lenders also operate illegally. But title loans are often expensive and may lead to consequences like ongoing debt or repossession.</p><p><strong>Where to find title loans and rates</strong>: High-cost title loans are illegal in 33 states plus Washington D.C., but some lenders find ways to skirt regulations, according to the <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/under-radar-evidence-prohibited-vehicle-title-loans-made-22-states-and-dc\">Center for Responsible Lending</a>. You can find car title loans online or at storefront title loan locations like TitleMax. APRs vary by state but can exceed 300%.&nbsp;</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> are unsecured no-credit-check loans with high fees. Loan amounts are typically $500 or less and — like cash advance apps — are repaid from your next paycheck. Though many states prohibit or restrict payday lending, single-payment payday loans with triple-digit interest rates are still widely available. Payday loans tend to create a cycle of repeated borrowing that leads to mounting fees.</p><p>It’s typically quick and easy to qualify for a payday loan with no credit history, but you should avoid payday loans in all but the most extreme situations — <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">personal loans</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">cash advance apps</a> are preferable.</p><p><strong>Where to find payday loans and rates</strong>: You can find payday loans online or at payday loan storefronts. In states where payday lending is permitted, the typical fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pawnshop loans</h3><p>Pawnshop loans are secured, no-credit-check loans backed by valuables like electronics, jewelry, or collectibles. Pawnshop lenders only extend a small share of the item’s value in credit and may charge high fees in return. If you can’t repay the loan in-time, the pawnbroker can sell your property.</p><p>While nonpayment results in you forfeiting the item, the consequences end there. The pawnbroker won’t try to debit your bank account or sue you for repayment as some predatory lenders might. Selling the item yourself could be preferable.</p><p><strong>Where to find a pawnshop loan and rates</strong>: You can get a pawnshop loan from a local pawnshop or online. Rates vary by state, but many pawnbrokers charge monthly fees that equate to triple-digit APRs. For example, pawnshops in Illinois charge up to 243% APR.&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal loan interest rates for bad credit</h2><p>You might not have “bad” credit (as in you haven't defaulted on any debt or made late payments).

Here’s how to build credit history:</p><ul><li><strong>Take out a secured loan:</strong> When you get a secured personal loan, you attach an asset, such as a car or savings account, to the loan as collateral. A small secured loan — with an equally small payment — can be an affordable and manageable way to show lenders you’re a responsible borrower; and since your collateral reduces the lender’s risk, you’re more likely to qualify. Note that if you&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/default-personal-loan\">default on your loan</a>, the lender can take your collateral.</li><li><strong>Apply for a credit-builder loan:</strong> When you apply for a credit-builder loan, the lender deposits a small amount of money into a locked savings account, which you pay back over 6 to 24 months. At the end of the repayment term, you’ll receive the funds. Loan payments are reported to the credit bureaus, so it’s important to make them on time.</li><li><strong>Get a secured credit card:</strong> A secured credit card has a line of credit equal to the amount you deposit with the company. After you show that you can make on-time payments, you might be able to get your security deposit back, increase your credit limit, and even upgrade to an&nbsp;unsecured credit card.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> Having a family member or friend add you as an authorized user on their credit card can help you piggyback off their good credit. Avoid using the account since the purpose is to improve your credit by adding their account to your report.</li></ul><h2>How to monitor your credit</h2><p>You can monitor your credit by:</p><ul><li><strong>Use credit monitoring tools:</strong> You can get a free credit score and analysis, plus debt tracking using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score\">Credible’s credit-monitoring tool</a>. Credit Karma and Experian also offer free credit tracking services. Check to see if your bank or credit card offers them, too.</li><li><strong>Check your credit report:</strong> Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> for free weekly reports from each of the credit bureaus.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Set up alerts:</strong> You can often set up alerts on your existing accounts to monitor and be notified of transactions and unexpected activity.

As your income changes over time, your payment may also change. However, your monthly payment will never exceed what you'd pay on the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan.</p><p>After making 20 years of monthly payments, your remaining student loan balance is forgiven.

If you're repaying your student loans under the PAYE Plan prior to July 1, 2026, you must switch to the Standard Repayment Plan, Extended Repayment Plan, Graduated Repayment Plan, Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan, or the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) by July 1, 2028.</p><p>If you're a new borrower on or after July 1, 2026, you won't be able to select the PAYE Plan. Your only options will be the Standard Repayment Plan or RAP.</p><h2>Who qualifies for the PAYE Plan?</h2><p>If you want to sign up for the PAYE Plan, you'll need to meet the eligibility requirements, which include:</p><ul><li><strong>Eligible loans: </strong>The PAYE Plan is available to borrowers with <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">Direct Subsidized Loans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">grad PLUS loans</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/direct-consolidation-loan\">Direct Consolidation Loans</a>.

You must have received a Direct Loan disbursement on Oct. 1, 2011, or later.</li><li><strong>High debt-to-income ratio: </strong>Generally, your federal student loan debt must represent a significant portion of your annual income.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the payments calculated under the PAYE Plan must be lower than they would be under the Standard Repayment Plan.

For example, we can't just arbitrarily change our mortgage payment and expect the bank to accept that.”</p><p>But in the realm of student loans, PAYE and other income-driven repayment plans make it possible for eligible borrowers to change their plan and opt for a different monthly payment.</p><p>Here's a look at how PAYE compares to the other IDR options.</p><h3>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan</a> is available to borrowers with Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, grad PLUS loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans (as long as they didn't repay parent PLUS loans). Like the PAYE Plan, IBR has a cap so that your monthly payment will never be higher than what you'd pay on the Standard Repayment Plan.</p><p>Depending on when you borrowed, your monthly payment may equal 10% or 15% of your discretionary income, and your repayment term will either be 20 or 25 years.</p><h3>Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">SAVE Plan</a>, which replaced the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan, offers the most generous repayment structure. The plan excludes 225% of the poverty line for your situation from your AGI. Your monthly payment will be 5% of your discretionary income if you have only undergraduate loans, and a weighted average between 5% and 10% if you have a mixture of undergraduate and graduate loans. However, unlike PAYE, your payments under SAVE aren't capped.</p><p>Your repayment term for SAVE could be as few as 10 years if you originally took out $12,000 or less in student loans. Every $1,000 above that adds another year to your repayment term.</p><p>Practically since its inception, the SAVE Plan has faced significant legal challenges. As of February 2025, the SAVE Plan is on pause — borrowers enrolled in the plan are in a general forbearance and don't owe any payments at the moment.</p><p>For many, the more generous terms of the SAVE Plan might make sense. But it's not the best fit for everyone.</p><p>“If you're approaching 120 payments for PSLF, you might consider changing to an 'active' repayment plan like PAYE or IBR,” says Robert Farrington, founder of The College Investor.</p><p>“I recommend this for borrowers with less than 10 payments left until forgiveness, so they can simply get it done this year,” Farrington adds.</p><h3>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-contingent-repayment\">ICR Plan</a> is the only income-driven repayment plan that allows parent PLUS loan borrowers to qualify (by consolidating with a Direct Consolidation Loan). Under the this plan, your payment is the lesser of 20% of your discretionary income or what you'd pay on a fixed repayment plan over the course of 12 years, adjusted according to your income. Your repayment term is 25 years. Unlike PAYE, there's no payment cap under ICR.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:13110":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"13110","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"compare-rates"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:276022":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"276022","content":"<h2>How to apply for the PAYE repayment plan</h2><p>If you want to sign up for the PAYE Plan, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Log in to StudentAid.gov: </strong>You'll need your Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID and password.</li><li><strong>Submit an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan Request:</strong> Start the process by completing an application for the PAYE Plan.</li><li><strong>Verify your income: </strong>You'll need to add your financial information and may need documents such as tax returns or pay stubs.</li></ul><p>According to StudentAid.gov, it takes most people just 10 minutes to complete the application.

Also, comparing total repayment costs from different lenders helps you see which lender offers better overall value.</p><h3>Loan purpose</h3><p>Your lender will ask why you need a loan during the application process. Common purposes you can choose from include <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">debt consolidation</a>, home improvements, medical bills, and moving expenses. Repayment terms and loan rates may be based, in part, on your intended loan purpose.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">What Are Personal Loans Used For?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:281494":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"281494","content":"<h2>$10,000 loan cost comparison</h2><p>This graph illustrates how different APRs can affect how much you'll pay over the life of the loan.

Any purchases you make and then pay off during that time would be interest-free (with on-time payments).&nbsp;</p><p>However, once the 0% period is over, you pay interest on your existing balance and any new purchases.

These often include personal loans, credit card cash advances, cash advance apps, payday loans, title loans, and pawnshop loans. But if there's an emergency purchase you can put on a credit card or BNPL plan, those are options too.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted, not all emergency loans are the same. They can differ in terms of cost, available loan amounts, access and eligibility, funding time, repayment terms, and more.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301462":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301462","content":"<h2>How do emergency loans work?</h2><p>Each type of emergency loan functions differently. Here is a breakdown of some of the different forms of emergency loans:</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> is a monthly installment loan that's typically unsecured, meaning no collateral required. Repayment terms typically range from two years to seven years, loan amounts may be available from $1,000 to $50,000 (or more), depending on the lender. Qualification hinges on your credit score, income, and other financial factors. If you qualify, you'll receive a lump sum upfront. Then you'll pay it back, plus interest, via monthly payments over the loan's term.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>Some banks, like U.S. Bank and Bank of America, offer small short-term loans up to $1,000 to existing account holders that can be deposited the same day. Loans are typically paid back over three months and often don't require a credit check. Fees are reasonable too for no-credit-check loans — in the examples above, they're below 36% APR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loan</a> &nbsp;are available from certain federal credit unions, these loans were developed as an affordable alternative to pricey payday loans. They're available in amounts up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to a year, depending on the type of PAL. Rates are capped at 28%.&nbsp;</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><strong>\"</strong>Buy now, pay later” apps, or <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL</a>, offer a way to make purchases now and pay them off, interest-free, over 6 weeks or longer, depending on the app. Companies like Affirm and Klarna are widely available for use in almost any retail setting, from grocery stores to veterinarians. Some apps also offer longer-term repayment plans, similar to personal loans, with APRs up to 36%. Purchases are instant and a hard credit check is typically not required for short-term plans, but may be for longer ones.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">Cash advance apps</a> look at your banking activity to determine how much of an advance to extend, typically no more than $750. Like payday loans, repayment is often pulled from your next paycheck. Though some cash advance apps don't require fees, it's the optional fees that can make them expensive — like tips and instant funding fees. The Center for Responsible Lending found that the average APR for a cash advance repaid in 7 to 14 days was 367%.</p><h3>Credit card cash advance</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p>A cash advance from your credit card allows you to withdraw cash in a pinch from an ATM. But you'll have to pay a cash advance fee, and interest is typically charged immediately. Plus, the APR on cash advances is usually higher than your card's purchase APR.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more is that if you carry a balance on your card, your minimum payments may go toward paying down interest and fees along with your lowest-interest balance first — meaning you should pay more than your minimum payment to pay off a credit card cash advance as soon as possible. Alternatively, you could use a personal loan to pay off the credit card and get a lower APR and longer repayment term.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pawnshop loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loan</a> should not be your first choice, but may be a better choice than a payday loan or title loan. Consider only if you can't qualify for a personal loan or longer-term option, and have an item to pawn that you won't miss and don't need. APRs are high, but if you don't pay the loan back, the pawnshop simply keeps your collateral — the loan doesn't go to collections, and your credit won't be damaged.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> is often a no-credit-check loan due with your next paycheck. You can generally borrow up to $500. But fees amount to triple-digit APRs in most states where they're legal, and are over 600% APR in some. In most cases, there are better loan options.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">title loan</a> is a short-term loan that uses your vehicle title as collateral. Typically, loan amounts are up to 50% of your car's value, and APRs can be as high as 300% — they're not legal in every state.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301466":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301466","content":"<h2>How to compare emergency loans</h2><p>Consider these factors when comparing types of emergency loans — such as a cash advance vs. a payday loan — or multiple loans of the same type, such as personal loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider the APR:</strong> A loan's <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, or APR, indicates the overall cost of the loan on an annual basis. It takes both the interest rate and any upfront fees — like origination fees — into account. If you're looking at loans that charge fees instead of interest, use a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> to calculate the APR. You can compare APRs across loan types this way.</li><li><strong>Compare monthly payments:</strong> The monthly payment is key because it needs to be affordable to avoid costly late fees and renewal fees. For instance, if you <a href=\"/personal-loan/500-loan\">need to borrow $500</a> now but can't afford to pay it back in 2 to 4 weeks, a payday loan or cash advance would be a bad idea. Instead, look for a longer-term loan, such as a personal loan, payday alternative loan from a credit union, or BNPL if possible.</li><li><strong>Look at available loan amounts:</strong> The <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">amount you need to borrow</a> can indicate the type of loan you should get. For instance, if you need to borrow more than $1,000, personal loans, credit card cash advances, and payday alternative loans may be your only options.</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms:</strong> Depending on the type of emergency loan, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">terms can range</a> from 2 weeks to 7 years. Make sure you can afford to make payments for the duration of the loan's term.</li><li><strong>Compare </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\"><strong>funding times</strong></a><strong>:</strong> What makes an emergency loan an emergency loan is that it delivers money fast. Some emergency loans can get you money instantly (or almost). But these often have the highest fees and APRs. If you feel you have to get a payday loan, title loan, or other high-fee loan, try applying for a personal loan as well. If approved, you could use it to pay off the emergency loan and any other high-interest debt.</li><li><strong>Know if a credit check is required:</strong> Even if you're credit-check-averse, know that <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">no-credit-check loans</a> often have the highest fees and most predatory terms. In fact, most loans that don't require a credit check are the kind that have triple-digit APRs. Prequalify with personal loan lenders (with a soft credit check) or check your spending power with BNPL apps like Affirm to see if you might qualify for a lower-cost loan with much better terms.</li><li><strong>Review lender reputation:</strong> Check out customer reviews via sites like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau, and Google reviews.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301470":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301470","content":"<p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>How to get an emergency loan</h2><p>The easiest loans to get are often the ones you want to avoid. Still, even easy loans have minimum requirements you'll need to meet.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare lenders and loan types:</strong> Compare APRs, terms, and funding times (along with any fees for fast funding) across the loan types and lenders you're considering. Remember that <a href=\"/personal-loan/interest-free-loans\">zero-interest loans don't mean “free”</a> and could be much more expensive than a loan with a high interest rate.</li><li><strong>Have sufficient income:</strong> Most lenders want to know your income to decide whether to lend to you and how much, based on your ability to afford payments. Many have minimum income requirements and require proof of income, as well.</li><li><strong>Meet the minimum credit score:</strong> If you're getting a loan that requires a hard credit check, find out the lender's <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirement</a> before applying, and know your own credit score. You can get your Equifax FICO Score 8 for free monthly through <a href=\"https://www.myfico.com/\">myfico.com</a>, or check your score for free with Credible's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score?utm_source=credible_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fbest-emergency-loans\">credit monitoring tool</a>. You might find a lender's minimum credit score requirement in their FAQ or on a personal loan marketplace. Not all disclose it, however.</li><li><strong>Calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> Your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> is a measure of your monthly debt relative to your gross monthly income. Some lenders, like personal loan lenders, use it to determine how much room you have in your budget for a new debt payment. A DTI below 36% is generally preferred for personal loans, although some lenders consider up to 55%. Add up all your minimum monthly debt payments, and divide that by your gross monthly income (before taxes) — the percentage is your DTI.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> If you apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>, you'll need collateral. In the case of a title loan, this would be your car title. Some personal loan lenders, like <a href=\"/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a>, also offer loans secured by your car, but with much lower rates than title loans. Also, note that borrowers in certain states may be subject to minimum or maximum loan amounts.</li><li><strong>Prequalify for a personal loan</strong>: Use a personal loan marketplace like Credible to prequalify with multiple lenders, or prequalify individually on lender sites. This step takes minutes and gives you an idea of the rates, terms, and loan amount each lender might approve you for. Even if you don't choose a personal loan, it can give you a good base for comparison with other loan types.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">How To Apply for a Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301474":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301474","content":"<p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How to Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Alternatives to emergency loans</h2><p>Sometimes an emergency loan isn't the best way to pay for unexpected expenses.

It helps the college or university of your choice determine if you're eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/pell-grant-calculator-and-eligibility\">Pell Grants</a> and other financial aid.</p><p>Your SAI is determined by the information you, along with your parents or guardians (if applicable), provide on the FAFSA. After the FAFSA is complete, you'll be assigned an SAI between -1,500 and 999,999. Lower SAIs translate to higher financial need.</p><p>The SAI replaced the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-calculate-your-student-loan-expected-family-contribution-efc\">Expected Family Contribution</a> (EFC) as part of the FAFSA Simplification Act and was first used during the 2024-25 award year.</p><p>“The new formula expanded access to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fafsa-how-much\">federal aid</a> and increased the number of students eligible for Pell Grants,” says Bethany Coleman, vice president of public relations, communications, and marketing in the Office of Public Information at the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency.</p><p>However, Coleman also cited potential adverse effects, which we'll highlight below.</p><h2>What does a high Student Aid Index mean?</h2><p>Generally speaking, a high Student Aid Index indicates a lower need for financial aid, based on the assumption that the student and/or their parents can cover the cost of tuition and related expenses.</p><p>If you have a higher SAI, you may find you're eligible for less aid (or no aid). A negative SAI means you have a greater need for aid, but there's no specific number that designates the threshold between high and low. And a high SAI at one school may not be considered so at another university.</p><p>Barbara Schmitt, director of financial aid at King's College, notes that “the SAI, just like the EFC, is the one number that comes out when you do your FAFSA,” adding, \"it doesn't matter if you go to a local community college or Ivy League school, that SAI stays the same.\"</p><p>To show why this matters, Schmitt used an example of a student with a 15,000 SAI.</p><p>“If they go to their local community college, which has a lower tuition, they may only be eligible for student loans. They may not be eligible for federal Pell Grants and they may or may not be eligible for state <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>,” she says. But she highlights the fact that if they go to a higher-priced school, “that would be considered a low SAI because it depends upon the cost of attendance.”</p><p>In other words, you may find that an SAI that bars you from receiving aid at one school meets the eligibility requirements for grants or institutionally backed aid at another school.</p><h3>The SAI and federal student loan eligibility</h3><p>It's important to keep in mind that there's more to a school's aid package than SAI-driven grants and scholarships. Depending on your financial circumstances, you may also be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">subsidized federal student loans</a>.</p><p>There's an indirect relationship between the two, however. Schmitt offers another example:</p><p>“Let's say the tuition at a specific school is $60,000, and a student has a 30,000 SAI and is eligible for a $27,000 scholarship,” she says. “The $27,000 is deducted from the 30,000 SAI, leaving a need of $3,000. If the student received another scholarship for $1,000, the total need would be reduced to $2,000.”</p><p>“The maximum federal loan amount (subsidized or not) a dependent freshman can get is $5,500 combined,” she notes. “The most out of that $5,500 that can be subsidized is $3,500. In this scenario, the student is only eligible for $2,000 of a subsidized loan and not the full $3,500,” says Schmitt.</p><h2>How is the Student Aid Index calculated?</h2><p>The SAI is based on information from the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">FAFSA</a>, which includes information about both the student and their parents, also referred to as “contributors.” Primarily, this information includes:</p><ul><li>Student and contributor tax returns</li><li>Student and contributor Social Security numbers</li><li>Cash and account balances, including checking and savings accounts</li><li>Net worth of any investments and bank statements</li><li>Any untaxed income</li><li>Household size</li></ul><p>Note that in the case of divorce, financial information about a parent's spouse may also be included in the calculation.</p><p>Further, Schmitt notes that in some cases, the new SAI calculation also changes who's defined as the contributing parent. This is particularly true for parents who are divorced or not married and living in separate houses, where one parent contributes more financial support, such as through child support, than the other.</p><p>“It's not the custodial parent like it used to be. It's the parent who provides the most support,” she notes. If you're unsure which parent is the contributor, Schmitt suggests using the “<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents\">Who counts as a parent on the FAFSA form?</a>” tool available on StudentAid.gov.</p><p>Once financial resources are tallied, annual living expenses are deducted, and the remaining balance is considered the amount of money a family can reasonably contribute to higher education costs.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:213658":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"213658","content":"<h2>What to do if you have a high SAI and need more aid</h2><p>If your SAI is too high and you need more aid, there are a few things you can do.</p><h3>Ensure FAFSA information accurately reflects current finances</h3><p>Schmitt notes that SAI is based on income from two years prior. For instance, if you're filling out a FAFSA for the 2025-26 school year, the information used to determine the SAI is based on the 2023 tax year.</p><p>“A lot can change in two years,” she adds.</p><h3>File an appeal</h3><p>If you feel your SAI does not accurately reflect your needs, you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/financial-aid-appeal-letter\">file an appeal</a> with the school you plan to attend.</p><p>Common reasons to file an appeal may include:</p><ul><li>Death of a parent</li><li>Job loss or job change that resulted in lower income</li><li>A natural disaster that led to the loss of a home</li><li>Divorce or loss of child support</li><li>Increased family size</li></ul><p>Schmitt points to those situations as conditions under which your school can make a “professional judgment decision” about your SAI and your current family circumstances.</p><p>“If a family's circumstances have changed, even if they're not sure how dramatically [they] changed or if the change will make any difference for them, they should always reach out to the financial aid office at their school,” she recommends.</p><p>If approved, the school can update the FAFSA figures on your behalf, noting that the federal government should base your financial need on the most current figures rather than those that were automatically leveraged when you filed the FAFSA.</p><p>Schmitt is also quick to point out that families should go directly to the school and not the Department of Education, as once the SAI is determined, the school is your only line of defense at that point.</p><h3>Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Need-based grants and scholarships can help take the financial burden off of families trying to cover the cost of higher education, but they aren't the only options.</p><p>“Students should explore other non-need-based aid types like merit-based scholarships,” recommends Coleman. “We always stress FREE MONEY FIRST!”</p><p>Merit-based scholarships, such as those for academic, athletic, or artistic excellence, are one way to pay for school, but there are plenty of other <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships for college</a>, too. Students may be eligible for scholarships based on where they live, organizations they or a parent are members of, degree paths they choose, or even hobbies they pursue.</p><p>To find scholarships, you should check with your high school's guidance office and your college or university of choice, as well as local businesses and organizations, and online databases.</p><h3>Consider federal student loans</h3><p>Students with a high SAI may not be eligible for subsidized federal student loans, or their eligibility may not meet their total need. However, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">unsubsidized federal loans</a> are not need-dependent, so you should explore your other federal loan options to determine if one makes sense.</p><h3>Explore private student loan options</h3><p>If you've exhausted all options and federal loans won't cover all of your expenses, consider looking for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>. Private loans aren't need-based and are offered by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.</p><p>Keep in mind that private loans vary by lender, with each offering products with different rates, terms, and eligibility requirements.

Auto loans have specific features that make them a better choice for purchasing a car.</p><p>Personal loans have higher APRs on average, meaning your monthly payments are likely to be higher. Also, as personal loans are generally unsecured and based on your credit profile, it may be difficult to qualify for the total amount you need — the average price of a new car was <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/february-2025-atp-report/\">more than $48,000</a> in February 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book.</p><p>Auto loans are usually secured by the car you're purchasing, meaning the lender can repossess your car if you default on the loan. While that makes it very important to keep up with your payments, it also lowers the risk to the lender and means that auto loans, on average, offer lower rates than personal loans and higher loan amounts.</p><h3>When should I use a personal loan to buy a car?</h3><p>Sometimes, a traditional auto loan isn't available to meet your car-buying needs. There are several scenarios where it might make sense to use a personal loan to buy a car instead.</p><ul><li><strong>Buying from a private seller: </strong>If you're buying a car from a private seller, it may be best to use a personal loan if you don't have the cash on hand to make the purchase, especially since most banks or credit unions may not offer the option of a private-party auto loan.</li><li><strong>A classic car: </strong>Most traditional auto loans are for cars less than 10 years old, so if you're buying an older car, you may want to consider a personal loan. However, some lenders (such as <a href=\"https://www.lightstream.com/classic-car-financing\">LightStream</a>) may offer classic car financing that is more specific to your purchase.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A restoration project: </strong>Instead of buying a new or used car, you may be looking for a personal loan to fund your restoration project of an older car. Some banks and credit unions offer restoration loans, similar to classic car financing.</li><li><strong>You don't want to make a down payment: </strong>Most dealerships expect a down payment on your car. A good rule of thumb is at least 20% for new cars and 10% for used, according to <a href=\"https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-down-payment/\">Progressive</a>. So if you want to avoid that cost, a personal loan may be a better option.</li><li><strong>You have a low credit score:</strong> If you have poor credit, you may not qualify for an auto loan. However, it's not guaranteed that you'll qualify for a personal loan either. Some lenders specialize in lending to those with low credit scores, but your APR will likely be higher, making the cost of the loan more expensive. It's best to improve your credit before using a personal loan to buy a car.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-vs-unsecured-loan\">Secured vs. Unsecured Personal Loans</a></p><h2>Personal loans vs. auto loans</h2><p>A personal loan gives you a lump sum upfront, allowing you to spend it however you like, within the parameters set by the lender. Auto loans are more similar in many ways to mortgages than personal loans:</p><ul><li>Down payments are sometimes required and can help you lower the cost of the loan overall.</li><li>The loan is secured by the vehicle you’re purchasing.</li><li>You’ll need to insure the car over the life of the loan.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:217318":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"217318","content":"<p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/auto-loan-vs-personal-loan\">Personal Loans vs. Auto Loans</a></p><h2>Pros and cons of using a personal loan to buy a car</h2><p>While auto loans are usually the better option for a car purchase, personal loans have some benefits as well.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>More flexible:</strong> Auto loan funds come earmarked specifically for the car you want to purchase, while <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a> can be used for nearly anything. If you want to buy a used car for $25,000 and make some repairs to your home for $10,000, you could theoretically take out a personal loan for $35,000 and do both.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-unsecured-loans\"><strong>Not secured</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Auto loans are secured by the car itself, meaning that if you don’t make your car payments, the lender may repossess your car. Personal loans are generally not secured, so if you find yourself unable to make your payments, the only damage is likely to be to your credit score.</li><li><strong>No down payment needed:</strong> While not all auto loans require a down payment, many do. If you don’t have that cash on hand, a personal loan can help you avoid that step.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive coverage not required:</strong> Unlike a traditional auto loan, you may not be required to carry comprehensive coverage if you <a href=\"/auto-loans\">use a personal loan to buy a car</a>.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Higher interest rates:</strong> On average, personal loans have higher interest rates than auto loans. That makes sense when you consider that personal loans are usually not secured, which makes them riskier for lenders, while auto lenders may be able to recoup their losses by repossessing your car. But higher interest rates usually mean that you’re spending more to borrow the same amount.</li><li><strong>May have higher monthly payments:</strong> Because personal loans often have shorter terms than auto loans, the monthly payments can be higher. Make sure you’re able to comfortably afford the monthly payment for the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>May not qualify for a large enough amount:</strong> Another consequence of not being secured, large personal loans may be difficult to qualify for if you don’t have an <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-excellent-credit\">excellent credit score</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>See Also: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">How To Get Approved for a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Tips for choosing the right personal loan to buy a car</h2><p>If you’ve decided that a personal loan is the best option for financing your vehicle, here are some things to keep in mind when shopping for a lender:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://write-box.appspot.com/\"><strong>APRs</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The annual percentage rate (APR) indicates the total cost of your loan, including interest rate and any upfront fees, so take your time to research different lenders and rate-shop. A 48-month loan of $50,000 with a 10% APR will cost you about $10,870 in interest over the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">life of the loan</a> — the same loan with a slightly higher APR of 14% will cost you about $15,584. You can save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars just by shopping for lower interest rates.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Many personal loans charge <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a>, a percentage of your loan that is often taken out before you receive the money. Lenders may charge other fees as well. Carefully review the terms of any loan and make sure you’re factoring the fees into the total cost of the loan.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> The repayment term is how many months you will be <a href=\"/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">repaying the loan</a>. Usually, the <a href=\"/personal-loan/long-term-personal-loans\">longer the term</a> of your loan, the higher the total cost. On the other hand, shorter terms usually come with higher monthly payments, which can be difficult to afford. It’s generally best to choose the shortest term you can afford to save money on interest.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Credit score requirements</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Since most personal loans are unsecured, your credit score is a huge determinant of <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">how much money you’re allowed to borrow</a> and how competitive an interest rate you’re offered. It may be worthwhile to take some time before buying a car to improve your credit score — it could save you money.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\"><strong>Cosigner option</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A cosigner is someone with a better credit score and history than the borrower, who will take on shared responsibility for the loan. A cosigner doesn’t share the ownership of the car or split the proceeds of the loan with the borrower — they just take on the risk of the loan and agree to cover the payments if the primary borrower can’t. If you have a friend or family member who will cosign a loan for you, it may help you qualify for a better interest rate, but not all lenders offer cosigner options.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:217322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"217322","content":"<h2>How to apply for a personal loan to buy a car</h2><p>Here’s how to <a href=\"/personal-loan\">apply for a personal loan</a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Check your credit score:</strong> Since a credit score is so crucial to getting a low APR, make sure your credit score qualifies you for the best rates out there. Pull your credit report and see if there are any errors to dispute.</li><li><strong>Prequalify with multiple lenders:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">Prequalification</a> is a relatively quick process that gives you a sense of the rate and loan terms you could qualify for.

Note those that have origination fees.</li><li><strong>Finalize your application:</strong> Once you’ve decided which loan is right for you, finish your application. You can expect to provide a government ID, proof of income, and other documentation. This will trigger a hard credit inquiry, which will likely ding your credit score temporarily. Read the fine print before you finalize the paperwork.</li><li><strong>Prepare for repayment:</strong> Once your funds are disbursed, you can purchase your car.

But if your parent doesn’t have good credit or isn’t comfortable cosigning, don’t worry — a cosigner can actually be anyone with good credit.

Just remember that your cosigner will be on the hook for the loan if you can’t make your payments.</p><p>Since a cosigner shares responsibility for the loan, they need to show that they can manage the loan.

However, your credit score is a major factor in the credit score you receive for a private student loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Private lenders can use various credit scoring models, but many consider your FICO credit score when reviewing your application. FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with the following categories:</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><img src="https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/311d9350-922d-4195-9876-123e12bfe58d" srcSet="https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/311d9350-922d-4195-9876-123e12bfe58d?width=234&amp;height=156 234w,https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/0c1bbaa4-0ed7-44bd-b526-b84533803cef 500w,https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/91af65e0-54a0-4c90-b771-2cf0ed4d6d72 750w,https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/d0a84bf1-ba70-417d-8441-37f990a66fcf 1000w," alt="fico-credit-score (2).png" class="image_resized" style="width:75%" sizes="100vw"/></p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The better your credit score, the better your odds of approval and the higher the rate you&#x27;re likely to receive. While most lenders look for a minimum FICO score of 670, even those with “good” credit scores don&#x27;t receive the highest rates. The best rates go to borrowers with exceptional credit. Meanwhile, those with “poor” credit scores receive the lowest rates, if they qualify for a loan at all.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The chart below shows average prequalified interest rates based on credit scores for borrowers who used the Credible marketplace to find a lender:</p></section><div id="infogram_0_85abbb37-2992-4df7-be23-40e6a65318f8"></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="student-loan-cosigner-credit-score-minimum">Student loan cosigner credit score minimum</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Many students ask a parent to cosign their student loan. But if your parent doesn’t have good credit or isn’t comfortable cosigning, don’t worry — a cosigner can actually be anyone with good credit. For example, you could ask another relative or a trusted friend. Just remember that your cosigner will be on the hook for the loan if you can’t make your payments.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Since a cosigner shares responsibility for the loan, they need to show that they can manage the loan.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments.

This means you can secure loans for future academic years without multiple hard credit checks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Citizens borrowers can also take advantage of interest rate discounts. If you or your cosigner has an account with Citizens Bank, you can reduce your rate by 0.25 percentage points.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments.

A negative SAI means you have a greater need for aid, but there's no specific number that designates the threshold between high and low. And a high SAI at one school may not be considered so at another university.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara Schmitt, director of financial aid at King's College, notes that “the SAI, just like the EFC, is the one number that comes out when you do your FAFSA,” adding, \"it doesn't matter if you go to a local community college or Ivy League school, that SAI stays the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo show why this matters, Schmitt used an example of a student with a 15,000 SAI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If they go to their local community college, which has a lower tuition, they may only be eligible for student loans.

Schmitt offers another example:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Let's say the tuition at a specific school is $60,000, and a student has a 30,000 SAI and is eligible for a $27,000 scholarship,” she says. “The $27,000 is deducted from the 30,000 SAI, leaving a need of $3,000. If the student received another scholarship for $1,000, the total need would be reduced to $2,000.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The maximum federal loan amount (subsidized or not) a dependent freshman can get is $5,500 combined,” she notes. “The most out of that $5,500 that can be subsidized is $3,500. In this scenario, the student is only eligible for $2,000 of a subsidized loan and not the full $3,500,” says Schmitt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow is the Student Aid Index calculated?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe SAI is based on information from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\"\u003eFAFSA\u003c/a\u003e, which includes information about both the student and their parents, also referred to as “contributors.” Primarily, this information includes:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStudent and contributor tax returns\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStudent and contributor Social Security numbers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCash and account balances, including checking and savings accounts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNet worth of any investments and bank statements\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny untaxed income\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHousehold size\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that in the case of divorce, financial information about a parent's spouse may also be included in the calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther, Schmitt notes that in some cases, the new SAI calculation also changes who's defined as the contributing parent.
