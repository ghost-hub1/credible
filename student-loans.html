    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I compare student loan interest rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To compare student loan interest rates, start by prequalifying with multiple lenders. You’ll see personalized rate estimates without affecting your credit score. Then, review APRs, repayment terms, and borrower benefits to understand which loan options may cost less over time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which student loan should I accept?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Start with federal student loans, which offer fixed rates, income-driven repayment options, and no credit requirements. If you still need additional funding, explore private student loans and compare interest rates, repayment terms, and borrower features."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What student loan rates are available in 2026?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Student loan rates currently available through the Credible platform for qualified borrowers include fixed APRs starting at 2.69% and variable-rate APRs from 3.66%."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much do student loans for college cost per month?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your monthly student loan payment depends on your loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term. Loans with lower interest rates and smaller balances typically cost less each month. A longer repayment term lowers your payment but increases total interest, while a shorter term raises your payment but helps you save overall."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I compare private student loan interest rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use a platform like Credible to compare private student loan interest rates, make a student loans comparison, consider insights from student loans reviews, and find low-interest options from top lenders without affecting your credit. Look at both fixed and variable APRs, as well as repayment terms and borrower perks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What affects current private student loan interest rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your student loan rates are determined by several factors, including credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, and whether you apply with a cosigner. Lenders also consider your school or program, and whether you choose fixed-rate college loans or variable-rate options."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a private student loan with bad credit or no credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can get a student loan with bad credit from a private lender, but it's difficult. Lenders usually require good credit, with most looking for a credit score of 670 or better. Applying with a cosigner who has strong credit can improve your chances of approval and help you get a better rate."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a cosigner for a private student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You don't always need a cosigner for a private student loan. But if you have limited or bad credit, a cosigner may be required. A creditworthy cosigner can help you get approved for a student loan and may qualify you for a lower student loan interest rate than you'd get on your own."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I compare private student loan options?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Compare lenders by looking at interest rates (fixed vs. variable), repayment terms, fees, borrower protections, and student loan reviews. Using a tool like Credible lets you view multiple prequalified offers at once without affecting your credit score."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score do I need to get a private student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most private student loan providers look for a credit score of at least 670. The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be. If you have a limited credit history, or none at all, applying for a student loan with a creditworthy cosigner can boost your chances of approval and help secure better terms."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use private student loans for non-tuition expenses?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can use private student loans for more than just tuition. As long as the total amount doesn't exceed your school's certified cost of attendance, you can use the funds for books, supplies, housing, meals, transportation, and other education-related expenses."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it possible to refinance private student loans later?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many borrowers refinance student loans after graduation to qualify for a lower interest rate, better repayment terms, or both, especially if their credit or income has improved. Refinancing student loans may also allow you to combine multiple loans into one. Just be aware that refinancing federal loans into a private loan eliminates federal protections like income-driven repayment or loan forgiveness."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is private student loan debt?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Private student loan debt is money borrowed from a non-government lender to pay for college. Unlike federal student loans, approval and interest rates for most private loans depend on your credit, and these loans come with fewer borrower protections."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you calculate monthly interest on loans for students?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most student loans are simple interest loans. To calculate your monthly interest on a simple interest loan, multiply your current loan balance by your annual interest rate, then divide by 12. For a quicker estimate, you can also use Credible's student loan calculator to model your monthly payments."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much is a student loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The cost of a student loan depends on factors including the amount borrowed, interest rate, and repayment term — all factors you can review when you compare student loans. Lower rates and smaller balances generally mean more affordable monthly payments. Choosing a longer repayment term can reduce your monthly bill but increase your total interest paid, while a shorter term raises your monthly payments but lowers your overall interest cost."}}]}

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments. However, cosigners on loans for international students do not qualify.</p></div></div><div class="styles_paddingWrapper__xi_iL"><div class="styles_otherDetails__C6QcA"><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Interest rates</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Fixed or variable</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Minimum credit score</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Minimum income</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$30,000 for most loans</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan terms</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or 20 years</p></div></div></div><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan amounts</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$2,001 minimum up to your school’s annual cost of attendance; lifetime limits of $200,000 for undergrads and $400,000 for graduates</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Cosigner release</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>12 months</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Eligibility</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Must be a U.S. citizen or DACA student enrolled at least half time at an eligible institution.

Cosigner release is also available after just 12 on-time payments, considerably shorter than many other lenders.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="styles_paddingWrapper__xi_iL"><div class="styles_otherDetails__C6QcA"><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Interest rates</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Fixed or variable</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Minimum credit score</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>670</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Minimum income</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan terms</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>5, 10, or 15 years</p></div></div></div><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan amounts</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$1,001 minimum, up to the school certified cost of attendance</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Cosigner release</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>12 months</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Eligibility</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Loans are available to Indiana residents only.

Each monthly payment first covers any accrued interest, with the remainder going toward the principal. Over time, as you pay down your loan, the daily interest charges decrease. However, if you miss payments, the unpaid interest may be capitalized, or added to your principal, increasing the total loan balance and future interest charges.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Federal loans have fixed interest rates set by the government, which makes them predictable over time. Private loans may have either <a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/student-loans/fixed-or-variable-rate" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">fixed interest rates or variable interest rates</a> that can change based on market conditions and potentially increase your costs. Most student loans charge simple interest. In rare cases, private loans may use compound interest, which can further increase what you owe. Because interest can significantly raise your repayment costs, it's important to understand how it's calculated and explore ways to reduce it.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">To minimize interest charges, consider making interest-only payments while in school, paying extra toward the principal when possible, refinancing for a lower education loan interest rate, or choosing a shorter repayment term. These strategies can help reduce the overall cost of your loan. On the flip side, ignoring interest payments — especially during school or <a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">deferment</a> — can lead to <a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">capitalization</a> and inflate your debt. Continued nonpayment after your loan enters repayment can lead to delinquency, default, and serious financial consequences like damaged credit and wage garnishment.</p></section></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__0pNmZ"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Editor insight:</strong> “To qualify for the best student loan rates, I suggest choosing one that you can pay off as quickly as you can comfortably manage.

Interest rates are the biggest factor determining the cost of student loans. Even small differences in student loan rates can translate into thousands of dollars over the life of a loan. While federal student loan rates are the same for all borrowers, private student loan rates vary widely depending on the borrower's credit profile.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For the 2025-26 school year, federal student loan rates are fixed at 6.39% for undergraduate Direct Loans, 7.94% for graduate Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and 8.94% for PLUS Loans. Private student loan rates on the Credible platform range from 2.69% to 17.99% APR for fixed-rate loans, and from 3.66% to 17.99% APR for variable-rate loans.</p></section></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><div id="infogram_0_b74257c5-d100-4d06-9677-7fcf1b1e3620"><script id="infogram_0_b74257c5-d100-4d06-9677-7fcf1b1e3620" title="PSL Weekly Student Loan Rates" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script><iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="border: none; width: 325px; height: 638px;" src="https://e.infogram.com/b74257c5-d100-4d06-9677-7fcf1b1e3620?parent_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.credible.com%2Fstudent-loans&amp;src=embed#async_embed" title="PSL Weekly Student Loan Rates" data-jvyycdlz="true"></iframe></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__0pNmZ"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Choosing between fixed and variable rates, or adjusting your repayment term, can help align borrowing costs with your long-term goals.

Each monthly payment first covers any accrued interest, with the remainder going toward the principal. Over time, as you pay down your loan, the daily interest charges decrease. However, if you miss payments, the unpaid interest may be capitalized, or added to your principal, increasing the total loan balance and future interest charges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFederal loans have fixed interest rates set by the government, which makes them predictable over time.

Each monthly payment first covers any accrued interest, with the remainder going toward the principal. Over time, as you pay down your loan, the daily interest charges decrease. However, if you miss payments, the unpaid interest may be capitalized, or added to your principal, increasing the total loan balance and future interest charges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFederal loans have fixed interest rates set by the government, which makes them predictable over time.

Private student loan rates on the Credible platform range from 2.69% to 17.99% APR for fixed-rate loans, and from 3.66% to 17.99% APR for variable-rate loans.\u003c/p\u003e","table":null},{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksInfogramWidget","id":"22","uniqueId":"infogram_0_b74257c5-d100-4d06-9677-7fcf1b1e3620","infogramTitle":"PSL Weekly Student Loan Rates"},{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"249066","content":"\u003cp\u003eChoosing between fixed and variable rates, or adjusting your repayment term, can help align borrowing costs with your long-term goals.
