    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better, credit card refinancing or debt consolidation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Credit card refinancing and debt consolidation generally refer to the same process. In some cases, credit card refinancing is a term used to refer to credit card balance transfers, while debt consolidation can refer to using a loan to pay off credit card debt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best method of reducing your borrowing costs will depend on your unique financial situation.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does consolidation hurt your credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Applying for a balance transfer credit card or debt consolidation loan typically requires a hard credit check, which <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">can cause a temporary dip in your credit score</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But debt consolidation can also help you pay down debt faster, which is one action that can improve your credit score. Therefore, debt consolidation may hurt your credit slightly in the short term, but may improve your credit significantly in the long term.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What does your credit score have to be to consolidate debt?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>There’s no one minimum credit score needed to consolidate debt. Qualification requirements vary by lender and credit card issuer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can check your credit score against each credit card issuer’s requirements or prequalify with lenders to find out if debt consolidation can save you money.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the three biggest strategies for paying down debt?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>While there are many ways to pay down debt, the three most common strategies are the debt avalanche method, debt snowball method, and debt consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The debt avalanche method involves paying off your highest-interest debt first, while the debt snowball method involves paying your smallest debts first to pay off individual accounts faster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Debt consolidation involves combining your debts into one loan or credit card payment with a lower interest rate.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to get a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You can usually complete an online application in a matter of minutes. After that, the review and approval process can vary from lender to lender, but some online lenders can approve your loan and make the money available as soon as the same day you apply. You might have to wait a few days or longer, depending on the lender and how long it takes to process your application.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A good interest rate is subjective and depends on the quality of your credit. Lenders typically reserve the lowest rates, and most favorable repayment terms, for people with good-to-excellent credit scores and good credit histories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to internal Credible data, the average fixed rate on a three-year loan is above 30% for people with credit scores below 599 (fair to poor). By contrast, the average rate on a three-year loan for credit scores above 780 (very good to excellent) is close to 12%. The average FICO score was 717 (good credit) in 2024, according to FICO data. Scores in the 680-719 range have an average interest rate of about 22%.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a personal loan a good idea?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Whether a personal loan is a good idea depends on how well you manage debt and the loan’s purpose. Securing a personal loan with an affordable APR and minimal fees and then paying it back on time can benefit you in multiple ways. The loan itself could help you achieve a specific goal, such as paying down credit card debt or buying a car. Paying back the loan on time could improve your credit score and make you a more attractive candidate to lenders in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, making late payments could hurt your credit and taking a loan out for something you don’t need could create unnecessary debt.</p>"}}]}

Repairs only count as capital improvements if they’re part of an extensive remodeling or restoration project.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:12882":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"12882","content":"<h2>How do capital improvements affect your home's cost basis?</h2><p>As Crystal Stranger, CEO of Optic Tax Inc. explains, your home’s tax basis is the amount you’ve invested in the property. The larger your investment, the larger your cost basis. Capital improvements increase your home’s cost basis.</p><p>Stranger says that if you sell your home, the cost basis is the amount you deduct from the sale price to determine how much capital gains tax you owe.&nbsp;</p><p>Each capital improvement you make increases that deduction and reduces the amount of capital gains on which you might be taxed.</p><h2>Are energy-efficient upgrades tax deductible?</h2><p>Energy-efficient upgrades aren’t deductible, but they can have tax benefits:</p><h3>Tax credits</h3><p>Unlike a deduction, which reduces your taxable income so that you’re taxed on less money, a tax credit reduces the amount of tax you owe. Each dollar of tax credit reduces your tax bill by $1.&nbsp;</p><p>The IRS currently allows two energy-related tax credits. The first is the energy-efficient improvement credit. It covers certain improvements such as energy-efficient exterior door and window replacements, insulation, heating and air conditioning equipment, biomass stoves and boilers, and the cost of home energy audits.</p><p>The credit is worth 30% of the cost of eligible items, up to $1,200 per year for most products. However, some items have higher or lower limits. Check the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/making-our-homes-more-efficient-clean-energy-tax-credits-consumers\">Clean Energy Tax Credit page</a> on the U.S. Department of Energy website before you start your project.</p><p>The second credit is the residential clean energy credit, which covers some of the cost of wind, geothermal, and solar power generation, as well as solar water heaters, fuel cells, and battery storage. The credit is worth 30% of the cost of these products.</p><h3>Capital improvements</h3><p>Capital improvements that upgrade your home’s energy efficiency increase your tax basis, like other capital improvements do. As a result, they can reduce the capital gains tax you owe when you sell your home.</p><p>If you receive a tax credit or other government subsidy for your energy-related home improvement or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/renovation-mortgage\">renovation project</a>, subtract the amount from your cost basis. You’ll increase the cost basis by the total cost of the eligible project, minus the amount of credits and/or subsidies you received.</p><h2>Can medical necessity home improvements be deducted?</h2><p>Medically necessary home improvements can be deducted in some cases.</p><p>One determining factor is whether it adds to the home’s value. If it does, it’s a capital improvement. In that case, you can deduct the costs that exceed the amount of value added.</p><p>For example, say you add an elevator to your home because a mobility impairment makes it impossible to use your stairs. If that elevator costs $40,000 but only increases your home’s value by $20,000, you can deduct up to $20,000 as a medical expense. If, on the other hand, the elevator increases your home’s value by $40,000 or more, the expense is not deductible.&nbsp;</p><p>IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502\">Publication 502</a> lists several improvements that typically don’t add to your home’s value. It includes projects like constructing ramps, widening doorways and halls, and adding handrails or grab bars. The entire cost of these improvements is deductible as a medical expense.</p><p>That said, the IRS has rules about who can deduct medical expenses and the amount they can deduct.</p><p>“Medical expenses have to exceed 7.5% of gross income to be deductible, including medical home improvements,” Stranger said.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:208166":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"208166","content":"<p>“The medical home improvements would need to be quite substantial to provide a deduction now, so few taxpayers qualify in practice,” Stranger said.</p><h2>How do home office improvements impact taxes?</h2><p>A home office can impact taxes in a couple of ways. In addition to earning you a tax deduction in the year you make the improvements, you also might be able to use some of the improvements to increase your cost basis and decrease your capital gains tax.</p><h3>Home office tax deduction</h3><p>If you’re self-employed and your principal place of business is in an area of your home dedicated specifically to your work, you might be eligible to deduct improvements to that space.</p><p>You can take a simplified home office deduction of $5 per square foot, for up to 300 square feet of space. Alternatively, you can claim the actual expenses you incur for improvements to your home office exclusively. Or, you can claim a percentage of improvements that benefit your home overall. The percentage is equal to the percentage of your home’s square footage you’ve dedicated to office space. The IRS calls this the business percentage.</p><p>For example, if your home is 2,000 square feet, and your home office is 200 square feet, your home office is 10% of your home. If you were to replace your roof, you could deduct 10% of the cost as a home office deduction. But if you have only your home office painted, or you replace windows just in that room, you can deduct 100% of the cost.</p><h3>Depreciation</h3><p>If you take a home office deduction, including for improvements, you’ll have to depreciate the business basis — the portion of your home’s basis that applies to your home office. Depreciation reduces your basis, resulting in higher capital gains tax when you sell, and that’s not the only potential consequence.</p><p>“If you have a home office and own your property, a portion of the gain when you sell your home will be taxable, based on the business use,” Stranger said. “This is true whether you depreciate the improvements or not, and the amounts for depreciation will reduce your cost basis whether you deduct them or not.”</p><p>So, while a home office deduction can reduce your taxes in the year you claim it, it can result in a higher tax if you sell.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are repairs and maintenance expenses tax deductible?</h2><p>The repairs and maintenance you do on your residence are not tax deductible unless they’re part of an extensive remodeling or renovation project. If you rent out part of your home or use your home for business, you can deduct the repairs and maintenance for only the rental or business portion. You can also deduct the repairs and maintenance on rental properties you own.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiExitIntentModal:2":{"__typename":"strapiExitIntentModal","id":"2","slug":"ltv/credit-score-exit-modal","title":"Do you know your credit score?","description":"<div class=\"raw-html-embed\">Get your <strong classname=\"bodySmall bold\">free</strong> VantageScore® 3.0 today</div>","extraDescription":"<div class=\"raw-html-embed\"><ul class=\"hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\"><li>Check your score anytime — without impacting your credit.</li><li>100% free.

Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

While there is not one set amount that you can reference, this breakdown illustrates where the money is spent:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan application:</strong> This fee varies from lender to lender. Some lenders charge as much as $500, while others charge much less or nothing at all.</li><li><strong>Home appraisal:</strong> Lenders hire third parties to determine the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-determine-house-value\">value of the home</a> you’ll purchase. The amount you’ll pay depends on where you live and which company does the appraising. Nationwide, costs range from $200 to $700.</li><li><strong>Loan origination</strong>: These are costs associated with underwriting and loan processing. Loan origination fees are typically around 1% of the loan amount. If you take out a $300,000 loan, you can expect to pay $3,000 for this fee alone.</li><li><strong>Discount points:</strong> You can pay additional money to reduce your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">mortgage interest rate</a> and save money over time. This fee is not mandatory. The amount of your interest rate drop depends on the lender. You may also have heard this fee referred to as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-are-mortgage-points\">mortgage points</a>.</li><li><strong>Title search fee:</strong> This guarantees the seller has the right to sell their home. Fees typically range between $200 and $400, but the cost depends on where you live.</li><li><strong>Lender’s title insurance:</strong> This protects the lender in the event there is a dispute with your home’s title. Costs usually range between 0.5% and 1% of the loan amount.</li><li><strong>Owner's title insurance:</strong> Title insurance will financially protect you against any issue that may arise from an ownership dispute after you’ve purchased the property. Title insurance is often around 0.5% to 1% of the purchase price.</li><li><strong>Homeowners insurance: </strong>Lenders require homeowners to purchase home insurance. At closing, you’ll have to pay for a year’s worth of coverage. The amount you’ll pay depends on how much coverage you want. A good rule of thumb, however, is to expect to pay $50 a month for every $100,000 you spend on your home.</li><li><strong>HOA transfer fee:</strong> If you’re buying a home that’s in a homeowners association, this fee covers the costs of moving all fees from the seller to the buyer. However, you may not have to pay this fee because it’s often covered by the seller in their closing costs.</li><li><strong>Attorney fees:</strong> Some states require a real estate attorney to close on a house. The amount you’ll pay depends on where you live and which company you work with. Some attorneys charge by the hour while others have a set rate.</li><li><strong>Escrow funds:</strong> You may be required to put money aside for future homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, and property taxes. The specific amount varies with each purchase and mortgage type.</li><li><strong>Title transfer tax and recording fee:</strong> Paid to your local government for the cost of transferring the title from the seller to the buyer. Cost varies depending on where you live.</li></ul><p>There are also loan-specific fees you may have to pay depending on your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage\">mortgage</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>VA funding fee:</strong> If you are an active or retired military member, and you choose to buy your house with a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/va-loan-vs-conventional-loan\">VA loan</a>, there is a VA funding fee. Because VA loans don't require mortgage insurance, the VA funding fee helps fund VA home loans. The amount of the fee depends on whether it’s your first time using a VA loan and the size of your down payment. You could pay between 1.25% and 2.15% of the loan amount.</li><li><strong>FHA mortgage insurance:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-an-fha-loan\">FHA loans</a> require a mortgage insurance premium to be paid at closing. The amount needed is 1.75% of the loan amount.</li><li><strong>Private mortgage insurance (PMI) for a conventional loan:</strong> Make less than a 20% down payment, and you’ll need to pay <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-mortgage-insurance\">PMI</a>. Each lender charges a different amount, but $30 to $70 for every $100,000 of the loan amount is a standard range. Many lenders require a month’s worth of PMI at closing.</li><li><strong>USDA guarantee fee: </strong>Can be rolled into the loan or paid at closing and is essentially mortgage insurance for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/usda-vs-fha\">USDA loans</a>. This amount is 1% of the loan amount.</li></ul><p>So how much are closing costs? As you can see, the final amount will depend on a wide variety of factors.</p><h2>How to pay for closing costs</h2><p>Paying closing costs can be done a few different ways, but the options below are the most commonly accepted forms of payment:</p><ol><li><strong>Cashier’s check:</strong> A cashier’s check is a check written by a bank to a designated party. Technically, the funds are drawn from the bank, which makes it more secure than a personal check.</li><li><strong>Wire transfer:</strong> A wire transfer is when funds are transferred electronically from one account to another. Depending on the bank, there may be a fee.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Certified check:</strong> A certified check is like a cashier’s check, but with a certified check the account holder still writes a check directly to the recipient. The bank then takes the amount and sets it aside, guaranteeing that the funds are available for transfer to the payee once the check is deposited.</li></ol><h2>Closing costs vs. cash to close</h2><p>While the two terms are similar, cash to close and closing costs are not synonymous.</p><p>Cash to close is the amount of money you need at closing to complete your home purchase. It includes your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/down-payment\">down payment</a>, closing costs, and other expenses, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/home-insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need\">homeowners insurance</a> and property taxes.</p><p>Closing costs are part of the funds needed for cash to close but don’t encompass your down payment, which is often the biggest amount needed at closing.</p><h2>Closing costs by loan type</h2><p>Closing costs are largely impacted by your loan type.

Your creditor will likely provide you with a Form 1099-C showing the date of the cancellation and the amount. You’ll report the canceled debt on Form 1040, and it will be taxed as ordinary income, according to your tax bracket. However, there are exceptions to this rule.</p><h2>Exceptions to the tax rules</h2><p>There are certain scenarios that allow you to exclude forgiven debt from your gross (pretax) income. For example, if your personal loan debt was canceled in a Title 11 bankruptcy filing, or if you are insolvent, you may not need to include the forgiven amount on your tax return. You are considered insolvent when your total debts exceed your total assets.</p><h2>Are personal loans treated as taxable income?</h2><p>The answer depends on whether you’re the recipient of the loan or you’re the one extending it. Unlike employee compensation, benefits, and investment income, the IRS doesn’t consider personal loan funds you receive to be income. (This is because you have to pay them back.) So, you won’t have to pay income tax on your loan proceeds.</p><p>However, if you’re providing the loan and receiving interest payments, you’ll need to pay taxes on the income you receive from the loan. For example, if you charge interest on a <a href=\"/personal-loan/peer-to-peer-lending\">peer-to-peer </a>or family loan, the interest you receive is considered taxable income.</p><p>And if the loan is more than $10,000, or the recipient invests the money, you’re required to charge them interest that’s at least the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/applicable-federal-rates\">applicable federal rate</a> published by the IRS. If you issue a loan with a below-market interest rate, you may still be required to pay taxes on the interest you would have received had you charged the applicable rate (that interest is called “forgone interest”).</p><p>However, if the gift loan is less than $100,000, the IRS only requires you to pay forgone interest if the recipient’s net investment income is greater than $1,000. If it is, the forgone interest you’ll pay is limited to the recipient’s net investment income for the year. That said, the limit doesn’t apply if the loan is used mainly to avoid taxes. Since the rules are tricky, it’s best to discuss your situation with a tax professional.</p><h2>Gift taxes and personal loans</h2><p>If you elect to give someone a cash gift rather than a loan, it’s important to understand that the gift may be considered taxable. The IRS may also treat a loan as a gift if it is provided interest-free or at a reduced rate. However, the following are not considered taxable gifts:</p><ul><li>Gifts that don’t exceed the annual exclusion ($17,000 for 2023)</li><li>Gifts of tuition or medical expenses</li><li>Gifts to your spouse (if they are a U.S. citizen)</li><li>Gifts to political organizations, charities, and certain exempt organizations</li></ul><p>You and your spouse can each give up to $17,000 in 2023 to as many recipients as you want without tax implications. Even if you exceed that amount and the gift is considered taxable, you’ll only begin paying taxes once you exceed your lifetime exemption amount, which is $12.92 million for 2023. This exemption covers both gifts and estate tax.</p><p>For example, if you give each of your two children $25,000 in 2023, you’ll have used $16,000 of your $12.92 million lifetime exemption.

Prepaid expenses aren’t considered closing costs, but you will pay them at closing.

Closing costs don’t lower your loan amount or provide you with ongoing services — they’re administrative costs to obtain a mortgage and transfer the title to your name in a real estate transaction. You pay them one time.</p><p>And while some closing costs aren’t negotiable, there are some key things you can do that can make a big difference in your bottom line. To lower your FHA closing costs, try these ideas:</p><h3>Compare lenders</h3><p>Finding the <a href=\"/mortgage/best-mortgage-lenders\">best mortgage lender</a> requires a little research on your part. You may see different lenders quote a range of fees and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/apr-vs-interest-rate\">annual percentage rates (APRs)</a> that affect both the cost of your loan over time as well as how much you’ll pay at closing; it’s important to compare your options to find the best rates and offerings.</p><p>When you’re comparison shopping for a mortgage, you may want to try negotiating with these FHA lenders. Lenders can pay for some closing costs or offer you a higher rate in exchange for a no-closing-cost loan.</p><h3>Shop around for negotiable costs</h3><p>Closing costs you can shop around for are noted on your loan estimate document. They include things like title insurance, attorneys fees, the cost of a home inspection, settlement fees, and other costs from third parties that are variable and can be selected by the borrower.</p><h3>Put down a larger down payment</h3><p>A larger <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/down-payment\">down payment</a> will decrease the amount of upfront mortgage insurance premium you pay. It will also reduce the amount of your mortgage's monthly premium.</p><h3>Get a shorter term</h3><p>The annual MIP premium goes down substantially with a loan term of 15 years or less. This won’t change the 1.75% upfront MIP due at closing, but if you get&nbsp;an FHA <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">loan pre-approval</a>,&nbsp;you may be able to see if you qualify for a shorter term and save on annual MIP costs.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ask for seller concessions</h3><p>You can negotiate with the seller to help cover your closing costs. It may be possible to offer more than the list price for the property and then ask for a percentage or dollar amount back to apply toward the closing costs.</p><p>Disclosure: Depending on loan type, different lenders in the United States offer loans to consumers with credit scores as low as 620, 580, or even 500.

We’ll cover each option in detail, but in both situations, you’ll be left with one monthly payment instead of several.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">This won’t automatically save you money, however — you need to check that the APR on the new loan or credit card is lower than the APR on your current cards. </p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_tip__LuW2g"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="tip Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_tipImg__EX55M"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_tipTitle__RIk_D styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Tip</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">Before you consolidate your credit card debt, ask your credit card issuers for a lower interest rate or monthly payment.</p></div><div id="partners-widget-block-5038" class="PartnersWidget_partnersWidgetContainer__5UM2H partners-widget-container"></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="ways-to-consolidate-credit-card-debt">Ways to consolidate credit card debt</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you’re looking to get out of debt faster, you have a few debt consolidation options:</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Balance transfer credit cards</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some credit card issuers offer a low or <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-balance-transfer.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">0% introductory APR on balance transfers</a>.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process.

However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

It offers personal loans for a variety of uses, including debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, and home improvement, with funding as soon as the next business day. You can also manage your account using LendingPoint's mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With low starting APRs and a mid-600s credit score minimum, LendingPoint is best suited for borrowers with fair credit or a limited credit history looking for smaller loans. Some borrowers with good credit may also benefit from a LendingPoint loan.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone. Available loan amounts are capped at a relatively low $25,000, Reprise may charge an origination fee, and there are no discounts for autopay or direct pay to creditors when using the loan to consolidate debt. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Low rates for bad credit</li><li>Next-day funding available</li><li>Secured loans</li><li>Extended customer service hours</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not best for self-employed</li><li>Low loan maximum</li><li>Origination fee</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$2,500 to $25,000 (Minimum $5,000 for OH, Minimum $3,500 for GA)</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 to 5 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>$15 late fee except where the state has a different limit (ie.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

If you have a lot of credit card debt and a fair credit score, you may achieve the lowest borrowing cost with a home equity loan, even with the associated closing costs. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">That’s because it’s often easier to qualify for a low rate with secured forms of financing. But you’ll need to own your home and have enough equity to qualify, and you should be aware of the risk of losing your home to foreclosure, which is a drawback of debt consolidation with a home equity loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you have good credit, you may be able to get a low rate on a personal loan and avoid origination fees. This might be your best bet if you have more debt than you can manage to pay off during an introductory APR period. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you have a small amount of debt and can qualify for a strong introductory APR on a balance transfer, that might save you the most money on interest, which is the primary benefit of debt consolidation. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Consider your credit score, total debt, and the time you need for repayment when choosing the best method for you.</p></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="credit-card-consolidation-vs-debt-snowball-and-debt-avalanche">Credit card consolidation vs. debt snowball and debt avalanche</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you&#x27;re uncertain about a credit card consolidation loan, consider two strategies for paying off debt without borrowing money — the debt snowball and debt avalanche methods.

Let’s use the earlier example that assumes a 30-year loan term and 6% APR, which results in a monthly payment of $1,498.88. Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

So, you won’t have to pay income tax on your loan proceeds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you’re providing the loan and receiving interest payments, you’ll need to pay taxes on the income you receive from the loan.

If it is, the forgone interest you’ll pay is limited to the recipient’s net investment income for the year. That said, the limit doesn’t apply if the loan is used mainly to avoid taxes.
