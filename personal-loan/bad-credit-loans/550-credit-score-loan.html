The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.  Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

Some lenders offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 550. However, you’ll have fewer lending options than borrowers with higher credit scores, and you may need to apply with a cosigner or co-borrower or secure the loan with collateral, like your car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another option for people with bad credit or no credit history is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">credit-builder loan</a>. Instead of receiving the money upfront, you get access to the funds after you’ve made all your monthly loan payments. Since you have to wait to get the money, however, a credit-builder loan isn’t ideal for emergencies.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the easiest loan to get with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>The easiest loans to get might be payday loans or cash advances via an app. But they’re not recommended due to high fees and very short repayment terms. Payday alternative loans (PALs) from federal credit unions are an excellent option if you need a $2,000 loan or less and are or can become a member. Small bank loans may also be easy to get if you’re an existing customer.&nbsp;</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What interest rate can I get with a 550 credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>If you can qualify for a loan, you’re likely looking at an APR over 30%. You might be able to lower your rate by applying for a collateral-backed secured loan or using a <a href=\"/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">cosigner or co-borrower</a>.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much of a personal loan can I get with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Loan amounts for personal loans for bad credit range from around $1,000 to $50,000. However, borrowers with bad credit are likely to qualify for smaller loan amounts compared to those with good credit. According to Credible personal loans data from November 2024 through October 2025, the average loan amount for borrowers with poor credit was $7,695.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to improve a bad credit score? ","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Improving a bad credit score takes time and consistent effort. The best way for long-lasting gains is to make monthly payments on time and keep credit card balances low. However, you could see quick improvements by using a personal loan to pay off credit card debt or by becoming an authorized user on the credit card of someone with good credit.</p>"}}]}

Then, consider <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">your budget</a> to determine how much of a loan payment you can afford.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prequalify:</strong>&nbsp;Check your rate with SoFi, Discover, and a few other&nbsp;personal loan lenders by entering your Social Security number and desired loan amount. This step only requires a soft credit check, so it won’t impact your credit score. Bear in mind that the prequalified APR is only an estimate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Choose the best option:</strong>&nbsp;SoFi and Discover may offer you a choice of repayment terms. Generally speaking, you should choose the option with the lowest APR, as long as you can afford the monthly payment. Also, compare options based on other factors, like the total interest, incidental fees, and the lender’s track record of customer service.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Formally apply:</strong>&nbsp;Proceed with the <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">formal application</a>. This typically triggers a hard credit check, which may cause a slight decline in your credit score. You may need to upload documents that prove your identity and income.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sign your loan agreement:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re approved, make sure the final rate and term still meet your needs. After carefully reviewing the terms and conditions, e-sign your loan documents.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get the cash:</strong>&nbsp;While the exact timeline will depend on your application and where you bank, you can expect to receive the loan funds in your bank account within a few days.</li></ol><h2>Which lender is best for you?</h2><h3>Best for debt consolidation: SoFi</h3><p>Unlike Discover, SoFi doesn’t restrict borrowers from directly paying off credit card debt from certain issuers. SoFi offers the option to send the loan funds directly to your creditors and even offers a discount if you use more than half your loan funds for this purpose. SoFi also <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-refinance-a-personal-loan\">offers refinancing</a>, so it’s possible to get a lower interest rate once you’ve paid down your debt balances.</p><h3>Best for low rates: Discover</h3><p>If you have excellent credit, you may qualify for a lower rate with Discover than SoFi, which could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the course of your loan. Discover offers APRs as low as 7.99%. You don’t need to enroll in autopay to qualify for the lowest rate, either.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for large loans: SoFi</h3><p>While Discover caps loan amounts at $40,000, SoFi offers large personal loans up to $100,000. That makes SoFi a great choice for costly expenses like <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">medical bills</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvement</a> projects. The bank’s seven-year repayment term option also provides for affordable monthly payments on large loans.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for small loans: Discover</h3><p>Discover offers personal loans in amounts as low as $2,500. That makes the bank a better fit for borrowers who need cash for smaller expenses like auto repairs or veterinary bills, since SoFi’s minimum loan amount is $5,000.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best for emergencies: SoFi</h3><p>SoFi is known for fast funding. If you sign your loan documents by 6 p.m. ET on a business day, there’s a high likelihood you’ll get the cash in your bank account that day. If you <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">urgently need cash</a> for a home repair or other emergency expense, SoFi may be a better fit than Discover.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiExitIntentModal:2":{"__typename":"strapiExitIntentModal","id":"2","slug":"ltv/credit-score-exit-modal","title":"Do you know your credit score?","description":"<div class=\"raw-html-embed\">Get your <strong classname=\"bodySmall bold\">free</strong> VantageScore® 3.0 today</div>","extraDescription":"<div class=\"raw-html-embed\"><ul class=\"hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\"><li>Check your score anytime — without impacting your credit.</li><li>100% free.

However, some out-of-state schools will allow you to apply for residency after a certain amount of time.</li><li><strong>School type:</strong> Public schools typically charge much less compared to private schools.

For example, the cost of health insurance through North Carolina State University during the 2023-24 academic year was $2,784.80, while health insurance through UC Davis is $7,992 a year for the 2025-26 school year.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:273034":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"273034","content":"<h2>Cheapest vet schools</h2><p>Midwestern University is one of the most expensive schools to attend during the 2024-25 academic year, with an average cost of attendance (COA) around $446,413 for Arizona residents and non-residents.

Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Unlike student loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">college scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> don't have to be repaid - which makes them a great way to pay for school. There's no limit to how many scholarships and grants you can get, so it's a good idea to apply for as many as you can.</p><p>Many scholarships and grants are specifically designed for veterinary students, such as the:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.akc.org/press-releases/american-kennel-club-announces-recipients-2021-veterinary-scholarships/\">American Kennel Club (AKC) Veterinary Outreach Scholarships</a>: For vet students who have participated in AKC events and programs; depending on the sponsor, students might be awarded up to $10,000</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/merck-animal-health-scholarship/\">Merck Animal Health Veterinary Student Scholarship Program</a>: Awards $5,000 scholarships to second- and third-year vet students with financial need</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/national-regional-scholarships/\">The American Veterinary Medical Foundation scholarships</a>: Offers a list of available scholarships and requirements for vet students</li></ul><h3>2. Fill out the FAFSA</h3><p>Fill out the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> before the deadline. For the 2025-26 academic year, you have until June 30, 2026. Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine what federal student loans and other financial aid you qualify for. Keep in mind that some aid is given on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's a good idea to submit the FAFSA as early as possible.</p><p>You might also qualify for school-based scholarships depending on your FAFSA results.</p><h3>3. Get a job or qualify for a work-study program</h3><p>Working during school could help you cover some of your school expenses. If you have financial need, you might qualify for the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study program</a>, which provides part-time <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">jobs for college students</a>.</p><p>These jobs are often on campus, though in some cases, you might work for a private nonprofit or for-profit employer that has partnered with your school.</p><h3>4. Apply for federal student loans</h3><p>If you need to borrow for school, it's usually best to rely on federal student loans first. This is because these loans come with federal benefits and protections, such as access to income-driven repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs.</p><p>There are two main types of federal student loans that vet school students might qualify for:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized loans:</strong> These loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students regardless of financial need. Unlike undergraduate subsidized loans, you're responsible for all of the interest that accrues on unsubsidized loans.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans:</strong> These loans are available to students who want to pay for grad school or a professional program. Keep in mind, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">grad PLUS loans</a> usually come with higher interest rates than other federal loans. They also require a credit check.</li></ul><p>After you submit the FAFSA, your school will send you a financial aid award letter detailing what federal student loans and other financial aid you're eligible for. You can then decide which aid you'd like to accept.</p><h3>5. Apply for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program</h3><p>Check into the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) after graduation. It's a federal program designed to help with a national shortage of veterinarians in rural and agricultural areas. Specialized vets focus on food animals, like cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry.</p><p>The VMLRP offers up to $40,000 per year toward eligible government and commercial student loan repayment to eligible veterinarians in return for their service in high-priority veterinary shortages for three years. These are the requirements:</p><ul><li>Have at least $15,000 in qualified veterinary educational loan debt</li><li>Hold a DVM (or equivalent) from an accredited school</li><li>Start within 90 days of award notification in a designated veterinary shortage situation</li><li>Meet all <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.9\">other requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.10\">regulations</a></li></ul><h3>6. Private loans for vet school</h3><p>After you've exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> could help fill any financial gaps left over. While these loans don't come with federal protections, they do offer some benefits of their own - for example, you can apply at any time, and you might be able to borrow more than you'd get with a federal loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable:898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable","id":"898","refiLenders":[],"isLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogLenderType","name":"Abe","slug":"abe","variableRate":true,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"660","loanTerms":"5, 7, 10, 15, 20","loanAmount":"$1,000 up to school-certified cost of attendance (aggregate $225,000 limit)","discounts":"Autopay, Good Payment Behavior","cosignerRelease":"12 months","repaymentOptions":"Full deferral, immediate, fixed/flat, and interest only","fees":"None","degrees":"Undergraduate, graduate, certificate, advanced degrees","vertical":"inschool","lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/05cbce1b-b2d8-4403-9a7b-233da5a6d1b2","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.3,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/abe-student-loans-review","bestFor":"Best for Payment Relief Options","expertInsights":"<p>Few private lenders match the borrower protections Abe offers.

The main difference between the two is that federal student loans are offered by the Department of Education, while private loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and online lenders.</p><p>“Federal student loans have fixed interest rates and can be subsidized for students with financial need,” says Chad Cummings, a certified public accountant (CPA) and attorney at Cummings &amp; Cummings Law, which focuses on wealth preservation.</p><p>“Private student loans have interest rates determined by creditworthiness. With excellent credit or a strong cosigner, a private loan's rate might be similar to federal rates, but many borrowers will pay a higher rate on private loans,” he explains.</p><p>Because the government provides federal loans, they come with many <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">unique benefits</a>. They have low, fixed interest rates, no credit score requirements, and offer access to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">loan forgiveness</a>. You can also apply for hardship options like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-deferment\">deferment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forbearance\">forbearance</a>.</p><p>However, federal student loans have <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/student-loan-limits\">annual and aggregate limits</a>, and they don't always cover the full cost of college. This is why many borrowers supplement with private loans.</p><p>Private student loans can have <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fixed-or-variable-rate\">fixed or variable interest rates</a>, and you must pass a credit check to qualify. Since each lender can set its own terms, private loans tend to be less flexible than federal loans.</p><h2>What types of federal student loans are available?</h2><p>There are four main types of federal loans available to borrowers:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Subsidized Loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">Direct Subsidized Loans</a> are for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The Department of Education covers the interest while you're enrolled in school at least half-time and for the first 6 months after graduation. But you can only borrow up to $5,500 per year, depending on your year in school and dependency status.</li><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a> are available to all undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of financial need. The main difference between <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">subsidized and unsubsidized loans</a> is that with unsubsidized loans, you're responsible for paying any interest that accrues on the loan. You can borrow up to $20,500 annually, minus any subsidized loans you received during the same period, depending on your year in school and dependency status.</li><li><strong>Direct PLUS Loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-direct-plus-loans\">Direct PLUS Loans</a> are available to graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduates. You can borrow up to the full cost of attendance at your school, minus other financial aid you've received, and a credit check for adverse credit is required.</li><li><strong>Direct Consolidation Loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/direct-consolidation-loan\">Direct Consolidation Loans</a> combine multiple federal loans into one. These loans can simplify and lower your monthly payments, but they can also extend your repayment timeline and increase the amount of interest you pay.</li></ul><h2>What are private student loans?</h2><p>Private student loans are offered by private lenders like banks and credit unions.

Reducing your credit card balances and other debt lowers your credit utilization ratio (the amount of available credit you’re using).</li><li><strong>Pay your bills on time:</strong> Consistently making on-time payments demonstrates financial responsibility. In fact, payment history is one of the most significant factors affecting credit scores, accounting for 35% of your score calculation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Avoid new credit applications and accounts: </strong>Too many hard credit inquiries can temporarily lower your credit score<strong>. </strong>You should also avoid opening new credit accounts if you're planning to apply for a mortgage in the near future. New accounts also lower your average account age, which can affect your score if you have a limited credit history.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increase your credit limits</strong>: Requesting a credit limit increase from your bank or credit card lender can lower your credit utilization ratio without incurring new debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Keep old credit accounts open:</strong> The length of your credit history factors into your credit score. Older accounts strengthen your credit history, so it helps to keep them open even if you don’t use them.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review your credit report:</strong> Errors on your credit report could hurt your credit score. You can request a copy of your report weekly from <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. Look for inaccurate information in your report, such as typos, fraudulent activity, old accounts that should have been marked as paid, and other errors. If you find incorrect information, file a dispute through the credit bureau and contact the party that provided the information to the credit bureau.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Build credit:</strong> If you have limited or no credit history, you can build credit by opening a traditional or secured credit card.

But if there's an emergency purchase you can put on a credit card or BNPL plan, those are options too.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted, not all emergency loans are the same. They can differ in terms of cost, available loan amounts, access and eligibility, funding time, repayment terms, and more.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301462":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301462","content":"<h2>How do emergency loans work?</h2><p>Each type of emergency loan functions differently. Here is a breakdown of some of the different forms of emergency loans:</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> is a monthly installment loan that's typically unsecured, meaning no collateral required. Repayment terms typically range from two years to seven years, loan amounts may be available from $1,000 to $50,000 (or more), depending on the lender. Qualification hinges on your credit score, income, and other financial factors. If you qualify, you'll receive a lump sum upfront. Then you'll pay it back, plus interest, via monthly payments over the loan's term.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>Some banks, like U.S. Bank and Bank of America, offer small short-term loans up to $1,000 to existing account holders that can be deposited the same day. Loans are typically paid back over three months and often don't require a credit check. Fees are reasonable too for no-credit-check loans — in the examples above, they're below 36% APR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loan</a> &nbsp;are available from certain federal credit unions, these loans were developed as an affordable alternative to pricey payday loans. They're available in amounts up to $2,000 with repayment terms up to a year, depending on the type of PAL. Rates are capped at 28%.&nbsp;</p><h3>BNPL</h3><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p><strong>\"</strong>Buy now, pay later” apps, or <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL</a>, offer a way to make purchases now and pay them off, interest-free, over 6 weeks or longer, depending on the app. Companies like Affirm and Klarna are widely available for use in almost any retail setting, from grocery stores to veterinarians. Some apps also offer longer-term repayment plans, similar to personal loans, with APRs up to 36%. Purchases are instant and a hard credit check is typically not required for short-term plans, but may be for longer ones.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-loan-vs-cash-advance\">Cash advance apps</a> look at your banking activity to determine how much of an advance to extend, typically no more than $750. Like payday loans, repayment is often pulled from your next paycheck. Though some cash advance apps don't require fees, it's the optional fees that can make them expensive — like tips and instant funding fees. The Center for Responsible Lending found that the average APR for a cash advance repaid in 7 to 14 days was 367%.</p><h3>Credit card cash advance</h3><p><strong>Use with caution</strong></p><p>A cash advance from your credit card allows you to withdraw cash in a pinch from an ATM. But you'll have to pay a cash advance fee, and interest is typically charged immediately. Plus, the APR on cash advances is usually higher than your card's purchase APR.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more is that if you carry a balance on your card, your minimum payments may go toward paying down interest and fees along with your lowest-interest balance first — meaning you should pay more than your minimum payment to pay off a credit card cash advance as soon as possible. Alternatively, you could use a personal loan to pay off the credit card and get a lower APR and longer repayment term.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pawnshop loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loan</a> should not be your first choice, but may be a better choice than a payday loan or title loan. Consider only if you can't qualify for a personal loan or longer-term option, and have an item to pawn that you won't miss and don't need. APRs are high, but if you don't pay the loan back, the pawnshop simply keeps your collateral — the loan doesn't go to collections, and your credit won't be damaged.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loan</a> is often a no-credit-check loan due with your next paycheck. You can generally borrow up to $500. But fees amount to triple-digit APRs in most states where they're legal, and are over 600% APR in some. In most cases, there are better loan options.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p><strong>Not recommended</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\">title loan</a> is a short-term loan that uses your vehicle title as collateral. Typically, loan amounts are up to 50% of your car's value, and APRs can be as high as 300% — they're not legal in every state.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301466":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301466","content":"<h2>How to compare emergency loans</h2><p>Consider these factors when comparing types of emergency loans — such as a cash advance vs. a payday loan — or multiple loans of the same type, such as personal loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider the APR:</strong> A loan's <a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, or APR, indicates the overall cost of the loan on an annual basis. It takes both the interest rate and any upfront fees — like origination fees — into account. If you're looking at loans that charge fees instead of interest, use a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> to calculate the APR. You can compare APRs across loan types this way.</li><li><strong>Compare monthly payments:</strong> The monthly payment is key because it needs to be affordable to avoid costly late fees and renewal fees. For instance, if you <a href=\"/personal-loan/500-loan\">need to borrow $500</a> now but can't afford to pay it back in 2 to 4 weeks, a payday loan or cash advance would be a bad idea. Instead, look for a longer-term loan, such as a personal loan, payday alternative loan from a credit union, or BNPL if possible.</li><li><strong>Look at available loan amounts:</strong> The <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">amount you need to borrow</a> can indicate the type of loan you should get. For instance, if you need to borrow more than $1,000, personal loans, credit card cash advances, and payday alternative loans may be your only options.</li><li><strong>Consider repayment terms:</strong> Depending on the type of emergency loan, <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">terms can range</a> from 2 weeks to 7 years. Make sure you can afford to make payments for the duration of the loan's term.</li><li><strong>Compare </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\"><strong>funding times</strong></a><strong>:</strong> What makes an emergency loan an emergency loan is that it delivers money fast. Some emergency loans can get you money instantly (or almost). But these often have the highest fees and APRs. If you feel you have to get a payday loan, title loan, or other high-fee loan, try applying for a personal loan as well. If approved, you could use it to pay off the emergency loan and any other high-interest debt.</li><li><strong>Know if a credit check is required:</strong> Even if you're credit-check-averse, know that <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">no-credit-check loans</a> often have the highest fees and most predatory terms. In fact, most loans that don't require a credit check are the kind that have triple-digit APRs. Prequalify with personal loan lenders (with a soft credit check) or check your spending power with BNPL apps like Affirm to see if you might qualify for a lower-cost loan with much better terms.</li><li><strong>Review lender reputation:</strong> Check out customer reviews via sites like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau, and Google reviews.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301470":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301470","content":"<p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">How To Compare Personal Loans</a></p><h2>How to get an emergency loan</h2><p>The easiest loans to get are often the ones you want to avoid. Still, even easy loans have minimum requirements you'll need to meet.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare lenders and loan types:</strong> Compare APRs, terms, and funding times (along with any fees for fast funding) across the loan types and lenders you're considering. Remember that <a href=\"/personal-loan/interest-free-loans\">zero-interest loans don't mean “free”</a> and could be much more expensive than a loan with a high interest rate.</li><li><strong>Have sufficient income:</strong> Most lenders want to know your income to decide whether to lend to you and how much, based on your ability to afford payments. Many have minimum income requirements and require proof of income, as well.</li><li><strong>Meet the minimum credit score:</strong> If you're getting a loan that requires a hard credit check, find out the lender's <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score requirement</a> before applying, and know your own credit score. You can get your Equifax FICO Score 8 for free monthly through <a href=\"https://www.myfico.com/\">myfico.com</a>, or check your score for free with Credible's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/free-credit-score?utm_source=credible_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=%2Fpersonal-loan%2Fbest-emergency-loans\">credit monitoring tool</a>. You might find a lender's minimum credit score requirement in their FAQ or on a personal loan marketplace. Not all disclose it, however.</li><li><strong>Calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI):</strong> Your <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> is a measure of your monthly debt relative to your gross monthly income. Some lenders, like personal loan lenders, use it to determine how much room you have in your budget for a new debt payment. A DTI below 36% is generally preferred for personal loans, although some lenders consider up to 55%. Add up all your minimum monthly debt payments, and divide that by your gross monthly income (before taxes) — the percentage is your DTI.</li><li><strong>Offer collateral:</strong> If you apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\">secured loan</a>, you'll need collateral. In the case of a title loan, this would be your car title. Some personal loan lenders, like <a href=\"/personal-loan/onemain-financial-personal-loans-review\">OneMain Financial</a>, also offer loans secured by your car, but with much lower rates than title loans. Also, note that borrowers in certain states may be subject to minimum or maximum loan amounts.</li><li><strong>Prequalify for a personal loan</strong>: Use a personal loan marketplace like Credible to prequalify with multiple lenders, or prequalify individually on lender sites. This step takes minutes and gives you an idea of the rates, terms, and loan amount each lender might approve you for. Even if you don't choose a personal loan, it can give you a good base for comparison with other loan types.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">How To Apply for a Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:301474":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"301474","content":"<p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">How to Get a Personal Loan</a></p><h2>Alternatives to emergency loans</h2><p>Sometimes an emergency loan isn't the best way to pay for unexpected expenses.

But regardless of the amount, know whether the money you need is in the form of a gift or loan. If it's the latter, clearly document the repayment terms, interest rate, payment amount, and schedule, and the recourse for the lender if you miss payments.</li><li><strong>Paycheck advance:</strong> Check with your HR department to see if a paycheck advance is available. This can be a relatively affordable way to borrow money short-term, as employers aren't allowed to profit from loans to employees.</li><li><strong>401(k) loan or emergency withdrawal</strong>: This type of loan or withdrawal could take a few days to a week to process. But if your plan allows 401(k) loans, you could borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if 50% of your vested account balance is less than $10,000. All plans allow you to withdraw $1,000 one time annually for an emergency expense.</li><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong>: There are a number of crowdfunding platforms for paying a wide range of expenses from medical and vet bills to rent.

Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of this lender:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:274170":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"274170","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Quick funding:</strong> You can receive loan funds as soon as one business day after you’re approved and complete all verifying documents.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Small loans available: </strong>While Universal Credit offers loans up to $50,000, it also offers loans as low as $1,000. Many competitors do not.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fair credit borrowers may be eligible: </strong>A typical minimum credit score for most lenders is in the 640 range — good credit, per the FICO scoring model — but Universal Credit's minimum requirement is lower.</li><li><strong>Long loan terms available: </strong>Universal Credit offers repayment terms as long as seven years (if you apply through Credible), which can significantly reduce monthly payment amounts.</li><li><strong>Debt consolidation money can be sent directly to creditors:</strong> This makes paying off debts quick and easy; it also keeps you from using loan funds for other purposes.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>High origination fees:</strong> All loans are charged an origination fee, which can be as high as 9.99%. This is higher than what many other personal loan lenders charge, and will reduce the amount you have available to spend or pay off creditors.</li><li><strong>High APRs</strong>: Even on the low end, Universal Credit’s APRs are higher than many other competitors.</li></ul><h2>How to qualify for a Universal Credit personal loan</h2><p>To qualify for a personal loan with Universal Credit, here are the minimum requirements:</p><ul><li>Be at least 18 years old (or 19 if you live in Alabama)</li><li>Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or possess a valid visa</li><li>Have a valid email address</li><li>Provide a verifiable bank account</li></ul><p>Additionally, Universal Credit may check the items below to assess your financial suitability for a personal loan.</p><h3>Credit score and financial history</h3><p>Universal Credit performs a soft credit check when you apply for a personal loan. This means checking your rate will not affect your credit score. However, if you accept the loan, the lender will perform a hard inquiry, which could ding your score for up to one year.&nbsp;</p><p>Universal Credit does not publish a minimum credit score requirement on its website, but you should have a FICO score of at least 580 to qualify through Credible. The company does take your creditworthiness into account when determining your eligibility and loan terms.</p><h3>Income and employment</h3><p>Universal Credit requires a minimum annual income of $25,000. During the final review of your loan, Universal Credit may request documents to verify your income and employment. This will prove you have the ability to repay the loan.</p><h2>Universal Credit personal loan purposes</h2><p>Universal Credit personal loans can be used for many purposes, including:</p><ul><li>Debt consolidation</li><li>Home improvements</li><li>Wedding planning&nbsp;</li><li>Emergency medical bills&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While you can use Universal Credit personal loans for a wide variety of purposes, there are a few prohibited uses to be aware of. These include anything related to post-secondary education (tuition, room, board, books, etc.), criminal activity, investments, or gambling. When applying for a personal loan, you must state the purpose of your loan in the application.</p><p>(Note that while the “no criminal activity” element may seem like a no-brainer, be aware that cannabis-related businesses may fall in this category as marijuana is still a controlled substance at the federal level, even if it’s legal in certain states.)</p><h2>Universal Credit personal loan fees and penalties</h2><h3>Loan origination fees</h3><p>Universal Credit charges an origination fee for underwriting their personal loans. This ranges between 5.25% and 9.99% of the loan amount and is deducted from loan proceeds. So if you have a $10,000 loan and your origination fee is 7%, you would receive $9,300 when your loan is funded.</p><p>These origination fees are on the high side. Moreover, some competitors offer <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a> with no origination fees at all. To get a loan with no origination fee, you should have good credit or better (a 670 FICO score or higher).</p><h3>No early repayment penalties</h3><p>Universal Credit does not charge any early repayment penalties. If you can repay your loan early, they encourage you to do so.</p><h3>Late fees</h3><p>You have a 10-day grace period when paying on your Universal Credit personal loan. But if you’re late, you’ll be charged a $10 fee.

Federal student loans for undergraduates in the 2025-26 school year have a fixed interest rate of 6.39%.</p><p>Using those numbers with a standard 10-year repayment schedule, you’ll find the monthly payment would be roughly $442. Borrowers with smaller balances will pay less, while those with higher balances or graduate loans may pay significantly more. This estimate illustrates what a balance might look like under the standard plan, but it represents only one scenario.</p><p>Many people aren’t enrolled in the standard plan. Millions of federal borrowers use income-driven repayment, which sets payments based on earnings and family size. That can lower monthly payments substantially, and in some cases reduce them to zero. The wide range of repayment options means there isn’t a single number that defines what most borrowers actually pay each month on their federal student loans.</p><h2>Average private student loan payment</h2><p>Private student loan payments vary even more than federal loans because they depend on your credit profile, the lender, and the repayment term you choose. Unlike federal loans, private loans don’t have income-driven repayment options, so your monthly bill is shaped almost entirely by your balance and interest rate.</p><p>For example, as of late September 2025, lenders on the Credible platform offered fixed-rate APRs from 2.85% to 17.99% on the low and high ends for private student loans. Repayment terms also vary widely, from as few as five to as many as 20 years.</p><p>You can use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/student-loan-calculator\">student loan calculator</a> to estimate monthly payments for fixed-rate loans based on different rates and repayment terms. However, some lenders also offer variable-rate loans, meaning the interest rate can change during the repayment term, making future monthly payment amounts uncertain if you choose a variable rate.</p><p>Because private loan rates and terms vary so widely, there isn’t a reliable “average” monthly payment that reflects what most borrowers might expect to pay. Those with strong credit and longer repayment terms may have more manageable monthly costs, while those with shorter terms or higher interest rates may pay significantly more.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Refinancing student loans</a> to a lower rate, if you qualify, is one of the few ways to reduce private loan payments.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:280666":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"280666","content":"<h2>Estimating how much you’ll pay&nbsp;</h2><p>If you plan on borrowing money for college, knowing the average student loan payment can be helpful, but what’s more important is making sure your loans are going to be affordable for you.</p><p>To estimate how much you'll pay monthly on student loans, start by taking the following things into account:</p><ul><li><strong>Your school’s cost of attendance: </strong>Schools publish their estimated cost of attendance, and you are allowed to borrow up to that amount using a combination of federal and private student loans.

Private student loans could have fixed or variable rates, and the rate you'll pay depends on your credit score, income, and other financial credentials. There are limits on how much federal aid you're entitled to. Your financial aid package from your school will tell you what sources of funding are available, so you can see if you need to supplement federal aid with private student loans.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your repayment terms:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, your repayment terms, including interest rate and repayment timeline, will affect how much you pay monthly.

Negotiate with the credit card company</h2><p>Before you begin paying off credit card debt, consider calling your credit card company. In most cases, companies sell bad debts to collection agencies for far less than what’s owed. Therefore, creditors often stand to gain more by <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/negotiate-credit-card-debt\">negotiating a deal</a> with you.</p><p>But what should you ask for? You can request a lower APR, a lower monthly minimum payment, a lower lump-sum payoff amount, or a payment plan. The <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-get-out-debt\">Federal Trade Commission</a> recommends being polite, persistent, and prepared with good records of your debts. A potential con to this route is that the deal could hurt your credit score.</p><p><i><strong>Check Out: </strong></i><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-vs-balance-transfer\"><i>Debt Consolidation vs. Balance Transfer</i></a></p><h2>4. Consider a debt management plan</h2><p>Another alternative is to work with a credit counselor to enroll you in a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management plan</a> (DMP). DMPs generally involve your counselor taking inventory of all your debts and working with your creditors to build a payment schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, your counselor will also get creditors to waive fees and lower your APRs. Once your DMP is set up, you pay into the plan each month, and the counselor pays your creditors according to the payment schedule.</p><p>A DMP may be a good fit if you’d like someone to take the debt planning, negotiating, and payment processing off your plate. You simply pay the amount due each month until the debt is paid off.&nbsp;</p><p>It may not be a good fit if you’re looking for a quick fix and to keep your credit accounts open. This route can take 48 months or more and creditors may require you to close your credit card accounts. It can also come with fees.</p><h2>5. Use a debt repayment strategy</h2><p>If you’ve decided to focus on paying down debt, consider the popular debt snowball and avalanche repayment methods.</p><h3>Debt snowball method</h3><p>The idea behind the debt snowball method is to pay off your debts, one at a time, from smallest to largest. You make the minimum payments on all of your credit cards, but pay more to the card with the smallest balance.</p><p>Once the first card is paid off, you move on to the next smallest balance, and then the next. Additionally, you apply the minimum payments from the paid-off cards to the card you’re currently paying more to, so the total payment amount snowballs as you go.</p><p>This can be a good method if you’re worried about sticking with your debt payoff plan. The smaller accounts are less intimidating, and you’ll get a motivating boost after each one is paid off. On the other hand, it could cost more than if you were to prioritize paying off highest-interest debts first.</p><h3>Debt avalanche method</h3><p>The debt avalanche method also involves making the minimum payments on all of your credit cards and paying down one debt at a time. However, instead of paying off the smallest debt first, you prioritize the debt with the highest interest rate. The idea is to eliminate the most expensive debts first to cut down on your borrowing costs, and pay off debt sooner.</p><p>A potential downside is that you don’t always get the early wins that you get with the snowball method. It can take longer to reach your initial payoff milestones, and thus can require more willpower.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:232250":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"232250","content":"<h2>How to pay off credit card debt fast</h2><p>If you’re looking to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/pay-off-credit-card-debt\"><u>pay down credit card debt fast</u></a>, consider using a 0% APR balance transfer card or personal loan.

Here are some tips on how to prevent it in the future:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a budget and stick to it:</strong> People often turn to credit cards when their bank account balances come up short. To prevent that situation, create a budget and work on sticking to it. Look for ways to cut expenses and increase your income.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\"><strong>Build an emergency fund</strong></a><strong>: </strong>An emergency fund should contain enough funds to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses. Having one in place prevents the need to rely on credit in a crisis.</li><li><strong>Use credit cards responsibly: </strong>Only use credit cards when they can work to your advantage, such as to earn rewards on purchases. Pay off the balances before interest accrues.</li><li><strong>Tuck away credit cards: </strong>If you’re concerned about impulse spending, take your credit cards out of your wallet and tuck them away somewhere safe. Leaving the accounts open can help your credit if you keep the balances low and make your payments on time.</li><li><strong>Close accounts if necessary:</strong> If you think the temptation to use the cards will be too strong, consider closing the accounts. This could harm your credit score, but not as much as racking up balances you’re unable to pay.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319282","content":"<p>Cash advance apps, also called loan apps, make it easy to get small short-term loans, fast, regardless of your credit score.

Chime’s weaknesses are its limited availability — you can’t use it in 17 states — and that you can only access an advance up to two days ahead of your scheduled payday.&nbsp;</p><p>If Chime is available where you live, it may be the right instant-money app for you if you don't want to pay monthly membership or instant delivery fees, want access to your advance within a day, and need more than $250 per advance.</p><h3>Albert's Instant Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for frequent cash app users</strong> <strong>with an Albert account</strong> who need multiple instant advances monthly and can repay quickly.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> up to $1,000</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $14.99 to $39.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Albert accounts or $5.99 to $19.99 to external accounts</li></ul><p>Albert’s strength is that it offers large advance amounts (if you qualify) along with budgeting and savings features to track your finances, a feature that could be a valuable tool if you’re trying to strengthen your finances and move away from cash advances. Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances. Plus, it offers relatively high advance amounts, if you're eligible. Additionally, it doesn't require a membership or per-advance fee. EarnIn Cash Out's main drawback is that you pay a fee for instant advances even if you send the money to an EarnIn banking account.</p><h3>Tilt Cash Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for users who plan to send their advances to an external account</strong> and want fee-free next-day access.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $10 to $400</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8 monthly subscription fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Tilt debit cards or up to $8 or 3% (for advances of $300 or more) to external accounts</li></ul><p>One of the biggest advantages of Tilt (formerly known as Empower) is that free advances to external accounts typically arrive within one business day, which was one of the quickest among the cash advance apps in our research. The app's drawbacks are its $8 monthly subscription fee and the relatively low maximum advance amount.</p><h3>MoneyLion's Instacash</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you </strong>have a RoarMoney checking account with recurring direct deposits.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500 without MoneyLion checking, $25 to $1,000 if you have a RoarMoney checking account with qualifying direct deposits</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> None, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $0.49 to $6.99 to RoarMoney accounts, $1.99 to $8.99 to external accounts for advances up to $100 (the app doesn’t specify costs for advances greater than $100)</li></ul><p>MoneyLion's main benefit is that it provides cash advances of up to $1,000 for qualified RoarMoney account customers. Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit. However, it's not advisable for ongoing advances due to high fees.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319294":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319294","content":"<h3>Varo's Varo Advance</h3><p><strong>Best for existing Varo customers</strong> who don't frequently request advances but need more than two weeks to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $20 to $500 (new users limited to a max of $250)</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> 8% of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances: </strong>None</li></ul><p>Varo's top advantage is that you can receive your advance the same day without paying an extra fee. Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month. If you're already a Varo banking customer, the Varo Advance could be a seamless way to access funds with a longer repayment period than most competing apps.</p><h3>Dave's ExtraCash</h3><p><strong>Best</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>you have a Dave checking account</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Up to a $5 monthly membership fee and per-advance fee that is the greater of 5% or $5 of your advance amount</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free to Dave checking accounts or 1.5% of the amount sent to an external account</li></ul><p>One of Dave's top features is that it provides advances of up to $500, and instant advances are free if you send them to a Dave checking account. However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

I like to think of this like any return policy at a store,” explains Emilio Cabuto, certified financial planner (CFP) at Verus Capital Partners. “If you miss that window, interest starts adding up from the day the loan was first paid out, except for subsidized loans, since the government covers that interest while you’re in school.”</p><p>Private student loans, on the other hand, come from banks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>, or online lenders — and each lender sets its own rules. “For private loans, the process depends on your lender,” adds Cabuto. “Always check your loan agreement and act fast.”</p><h2>How to return unused student loan funds</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step process on how to return unused student loan funds.</p><h3>1. Review the amount</h3><p>Figure out exactly how much of your loan money you don’t need. For instance, if your living costs are lower than expected or you’ve received extra scholarships or grants, you might have borrowed more than necessary. Before returning any funds, carefully compare the amount you have against how much you expect to spend, then calculate the specific amount you want to send back.</p><h3>2. Contact your school’s financial aid office</h3><p>Reach out to your school’s financial aid office to let them know you want to return the unused student loan funds. This is easiest to do before your loan is disbursed. If your loan has already been disbursed, there are different processes depending on the timing.&nbsp;</p><p>You may have 14 to 30 days to cancel all or a portion of your student loan after you receive notification of your rights to cancel your loan. But each school can have different timetables, so review what applies to you. Within this time frame, your school must process your cancellation request.&nbsp;</p><p>After that window closes, you can contact your school’s financial aid office, but you may have to return the funds directly to your loan servicer.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Reach out to your loan servicer or lender&nbsp;</h3><p>If your school is unable to process the request to return or cancel the funds, contact your loan servicer or lender. To return&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">federal student loan funds</a>, find your loan servicer on your Federal Student Aid (StudentAid.gov) account. Go to the “My Loan Servicers” section. If you want to return unused private student loans, contact the lender. Each lender may have a different process and timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>Federal student loan funds that are returned within 120 days of disbursement won’t accrue interest or fees. After the 120-day period, you can still return the funds, but interest and fees apply. It will also be processed as a prepayment on your loan. So, instead of a typical return, you’ll essentially be paying back unused student loan funds.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have private student loans, check with your lender on the timeline and process. Interest may accrue on the loans. For example, SoFi notes that borrowers can cancel a second disbursement of their student loan.&nbsp;</p><p>After a disbursement, the school can send the loan disbursement refund to SoFi, which then sends the amount to its loan servicing partner. If the loan funds are disbursed to you, then you can return them to the lender as an early payment.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:14994":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"14994","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:306042":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"306042","content":"<h2>When can you return student loan money without interest?</h2><p>If you want to return student loan money and avoid paying interest, timing and the type of student loan matter.

But in reality, everyone starts in the same place: “credit invisible,” meaning you don't have any credit history with the three major credit bureaus.</p><p>If you're eager to get your credit history started, the best way to build credit from scratch is through a controlled approach.</p><h3>Open a secured credit card</h3><p>A secured credit card offers the convenience of making on-the-go purchases using a credit card without the risk of spending beyond your means. To open one, you'll need to provide a small, one-time security deposit — often around $300 or less. This deposit acts as collateral and usually sets your credit limit.</p><p>You can then use the card for everyday purchases and make monthly installment payments as you would with a traditional credit card. All of the activity on the card — including card use and payment data — is reported to the credit bureaus, which generates a credit history under your name.</p><p>After proving responsible credit card use and repayment behavior over time, you might have an opportunity to qualify for a traditional credit card.</p><h3>Become an authorized user on someone else's account</h3><p>Becoming an authorized user on an existing credit card account can help you passively establish your credit from scratch. With this strategy, you'd ask someone you're close to — like a parent, sibling, or spouse — to add your name as an authorized user on their card. Although you're technically allowed to use the card, you don't need to make any personal purchases or payments toward it. Instead, you can simply piggyback off the primary account holder's account activity.</p><p>All purchases and payments the account holder makes on the card are reported to the credit bureaus. If the card issuer also reports authorized user data, that information will appear on your credit report and help you establish a credit history.</p><p>That said, this strategy only works if the primary account holder uses the credit card responsibly.</p><p>“Being added as an authorized user on a responsible person's account can help, but ensure the account has a low utilization rate and a long positive history,” says Justin Haywood, a certified financial planner (CFP) and co-founder of Haywood Wealth Management. “The primary account holder must maintain good payment habits for this to be effective.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:228390":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"228390","content":"<h3>Get a credit-builder loan</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-builder-loan\">Credit-builder loans</a> are commonly available through <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>. When you take out this type of loan, the lender locks the borrowed amount — usually $300 to $1,000 — into an account instead of giving you the funds up front.</p><p>You'll then make monthly installment payments, plus interest, for a term of six to 24 months. The lender reports the payment activity to the credit bureaus, which builds your credit profile. After successfully making all of your payments, the loan is considered repaid, and you'll get access to the funds in the deposit account.</p><h2>How to improve your credit score over time</h2><p>After building a credit history, the next step is to improve your score. A higher credit score signals stronger credit, which can help you qualify for better financial products and interest rates. Here are some credit-building tips for beginners:</p><ul><li><strong>Make on-time payments: </strong>Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score calculation. Ensure you're paying at least the minimum amount due each month on or before the due date, and stay consistent month to month.</li><li><strong>Keep credit utilization low:</strong> Credit utilization refers to how much of your available credit you're using, and it makes up 30% of your FICO score. Aim to keep your credit utilization under 30%.</li><li><strong>Apply for new credit sparingly: </strong>How frequently you open a new credit account and the time between opening new accounts makes up 10% of your FICO score. Avoid opening new accounts in rapid succession just to establish your credit.</li></ul><p>“Credit utilization is one of the easiest things to control, and it makes a huge difference in your score,” says Joe Camberato, CEO and founder of National Business Capital, a private lender that helps business owners secure competitive financing options.</p><p>“Even if you pay off your card in full every month, your balance at the time your statement closes is what gets reported, so keeping your spending low throughout the month helps,” Camberato adds.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:8602":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"8602","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"mortgage"}],"type":"simple-cta","variation":"learn-about-home-loans"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:228394":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"228394","content":"<h2>Common mistakes to avoid when building credit</h2><p>It's easy to slip into habits that cause your credit score to drop. Here are a few pitfalls to avoid:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing or late payments:</strong> Payment history impacts your credit score the most, so you want to avoid making late payments or forgetting a payment altogether. If you're new to managing monthly bills, consider enrolling in auto-pay or setting up a reminder on your calendar to pay your credit card or loan bill each month.</li><li><strong>Closing old credit accounts too soon: </strong>The longer you responsibly maintain credit accounts, the better it is for your score. That's because the length of your credit history makes up 15% of your FICO score.

Loans can have widely different interest rates, fees, and monthly payments. Here's how to compare your options from different lenders.</p><h3>1. Interest rates</h3><p>A personal loan's <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a>, or APR, accounts for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees. APR provides the most comprehensive way to measure the cost of borrowing money on an annualized basis.</p><p>Lenders typically charge between 6.49% and 35.99% APR for personal loans. However, your rate depends on several factors, like your credit score and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a>.</p><p>For example, Wells Fargo estimates that borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher (very good credit, according to the FICO score range) may be eligible for an APR of 11.50% to 16.00% on a seven-year, $95,000 loan. Meanwhile, borrowers with credit scores in the 700 to 759 (good credit, according to FICO) may qualify for APRs of 17.25% to 19.00% on the same loan.</p><h3>2. Fees</h3><p>Not all lenders charge fees to borrow $95,000. For lenders that do, these fees can increase your total repayment costs.</p><p>Late fees are among the most common, but they only occur if you're late making a payment. Lenders usually give a grace period for missed payments before assessing a late fee, which is typically a flat fee or a percentage of your missed payment amount.</p><p>Your lender may also impose an upfront fee, also called an origination fee, to offset their administrative fees or reduce their risk. Origination fees typically range from less than 1% to as much as 15% of the loan amount, and lenders generally deduct the fee from your loan upfront. So, if you borrow $95,000 with a 2% origination fee, you would receive $93,100.</p><p>Less common for personal loans is a prepayment penalty, which is a lender's charge for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\">paying off your loan early</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265850":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265850","content":"<h3>3. Repayment terms</h3><p>Your repayment term is the length of time you have to pay off your loan. Lenders typically offer <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">two- to seven-year terms</a>, although BHG Financial offers repayment terms of three to 10 years. You can sometimes get longer repayment terms for specific loan purposes, like home repairs. For example, LightStream allows up to 20 years to pay off home improvement loans.</p><p>A longer loan term can lower your monthly payment by spreading the amount you owe over more months. But a longer repayment term typically means higher interest costs over the life of the loan, so you'll need to weigh whether lower monthly payments or paying less interest overall best fits your financial goals.</p><h3>4. Monthly payment</h3><p>You'll pay a $95,000 personal loan in equal installments each month that include your principal and interest. Your monthly payment should fit comfortably into your monthly budget, but keep in mind that a loan for $95,000 could cost around $2,000 per month or more, unless you get an extended repayment term or a very low interest rate.</p><p>When comparing loan quotes, look at how different repayment terms and APRs affect your monthly payment. Many online lenders offer calculators for loan estimates or let you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a loan</a> to see what you may qualify for and get an idea of your potential monthly payment.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265854":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265854","content":"<h3>5. Total repayment costs</h3><p>One way to gauge whether a $95,000 personal loan fits into your financial picture is to consider your total repayment costs, including the total interest charged and fees. For example, if you borrow $95,000 with a 23% APR for seven years, you'll end up paying about $96,000 in interest alone, more than the amount you borrowed. Use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to break down these costs ahead of time.</p><h2>What is the cost to repay a $95,000 loan?</h2><p>A $95,000 personal loan repaid over at least five years would likely have a monthly payment of $2,000 or more, which equates to over $40,000 in total interest paid over the loan term.

These estimates can help you strike a balance between a monthly payment you can comfortably afford and how much interest you want to pay over the life of the loan.</p><h3>Apply</h3><p>Choose the lender offering the rate, terms, and services you prefer. Submit an official application and include all documents requested by the lender, such as income verification.</p><h3>Review and sign the loan agreement</h3><p>Once approved, you'll need to review the loan agreement from your lender. It details all the fine print about your loan, including your interest rate, monthly payment, fees, and prohibited loan uses. If you agree to all terms, sign the document and send it back to your lender.</p><h3>Get funded</h3><p>Lenders usually fund loans within a few business days of signing the agreement, but check with your lender about its funding times. Your lender will also let you know when your first payment is due.</p><h2>Alternatives to a $95,000 loan</h2><p>Home equity and secured funding options may offer lower interest rates than a personal loan, but still give you access to $95,000.</p><h3>Use your home equity</h3><p>Home equity is the amount of your home and property you own outright. For example, if your home is worth $400,000 and you owe $150,000 on your mortgage, you have $250,000 in home equity. Some banks and credit unions offer home equity borrowing options to tap into this equity. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Home equity loan:</strong> A home equity loan is a lump sum payment with a fixed interest rate and repayment term, similar to a personal loan. It's a good option if you know exactly how much you need to borrow.</li><li><strong>Home equity line of credit (HELOC):</strong> You'll get flexible access to funds as needed with a HELOC, up to a set credit limit. Unlike a personal loan, a HELOC usually has a variable interest rate, and you only pay interest on what you borrow. So, if you're not sure you need as much as $95,000, you could save some money with a HELOC.</li><li><strong>Cash-out refinance:</strong> A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a larger one, allowing you to borrow the extra money to use for virtually any purpose. You may also get a better interest rate than your current mortgage by refinancing.</li></ul><p>While beneficial in some cases, home equity options should be used with caution. If you fail to pay any home equity loans or lines of credit, you'll put your home at risk. Gary Hemming, owner and finance director of ABC Finance, also warns of a risk known as equity lock. “If neighborhood property values dip, even slightly, lenders can freeze your HELOC or deny a refinance, regardless of your credit score or payment history,” says Hemming. “You're left with large monthly payments, but no access to additional capital.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/home-equity-loan-vs-line-credit\">HELOC vs. Home Equity Loan: How To Decide</a></p><h3>Opt for other secured loans or lines of credit</h3><p>A secured loan uses an asset as collateral. Because your asset is tied to the loan, the lender's risk lowers, which usually gives you a better interest rate and higher borrowing limits than an unsecured loan.</p><p>Similar to home equity financing, lenders may offer a loan or line of credit secured by your savings account or investments like stocks, bonds, and ETFs (exchange-traded funds).</p><p>Secured financing also comes with the risk of losing your asset if you don't pay. You may also not be able to borrow the full amount of your asset. And if you use an investment portfolio as collateral, market downturns can impact your borrowing power. Eric Mangold, certified wealth strategist and founder of Argosy Wealth Management, says: “If the portfolio declines significantly due to a market downturn, and the portfolio value falls below what was borrowed, the borrower may be required to deposit additional funds or sell some of the portfolio.”</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:86214":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"86214","content":"<p>When you apply for most traditional mortgages, you’ll hand the lender a stack of documents to prove your financial health and show you can repay the loan.</p><p>If your income is hard to document or you’re looking to guard your privacy, a different type of mortgage might appeal to you.

It depends on the size of your down payment, credit score, assets, and how much you can disclose about your employment.</li><li><strong>Credit score and down payment requirements are higher: </strong>No-doc loans usually set minimum credit score requirements of around 700.

You might still come out ahead, but compare the interest costs on your original loan and the new loan to be sure.</p><h3>How to know when you’ll break even</h3><p>To figure out how long it will take to recoup your refinance expenses, divide the amount of your closing costs by the amount you save each month.

To see if you come out ahead, figure out the interest costs on your current loan and the new mortgage.</p><p><strong>For example:&nbsp;</strong>Say you took out a 30-year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/300000-mortgage\">$300,000 mortgage</a>&nbsp;with a fixed interest rate of 4% and a 20% down payment.

But one year into the loan, you swap out your mortgage for a new 30-year loan with a 3% interest rate.</p><p>In this example, a refinance lowers your monthly payments by $151 and saves you $41,132 in interest over the life of the loan.</p><p><strong>Find Out:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/worth-refinancing-for-half-percent\">Is It Worth Refinancing a Mortgage for 0.5% Off?</a></p><h3>To pay off your loan sooner</h3><p>If getting out of debt ASAP is important to you, then refinancing into a shorter-term loan can help. While your monthly payments will likely climb because you’re paying off debt within a shorter time frame, you could save a lot on interest costs.</p><p>Take a look at the original mortgage from the example above. If you refinance from a 30-year loan with a 4% rate&nbsp;into a 15-year mortgage&nbsp;with a 3% rate, you’ll take on a higher monthly payment, but you’ll also pay off your mortgage 14 years sooner. In the process, you save $105,911 in interest compared to your original loan.</p><h3>To change to a different loan type</h3><p>Homeowners can also refinance from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/adjustable-rate-mortgage\">adjustable-rate mortgage</a>&nbsp;(ARM) to a fixed-rate loan — or vice versa.</p><p><strong>What you should know:</strong>&nbsp;ARMs start with a low interest rate for a specified period; then, the rate can go up or down for the remainder of the loan term. That may result in a higher interest rate, which drives up your monthly payments. By refinancing to a fixed-rate loan, you don’t have to worry about future interest rate hikes.</p><p>Conversely, shifting from a fixed-rate loan to an ARM can be a good financial strategy if interest rates are falling and you don’t plan to stay in your home for long.</p><p><strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-5-1-arm\">5/1 ARM: Your Guide to 5-Year Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</a></p><h3>To tap into home equity</h3><p>Tapping into your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit\">home equity</a>&nbsp;through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/cash-out-refinancing\">cash-out refinance</a>&nbsp;is another reason to refinance.

At that point, the entire unpaid balance becomes immediately due, and the loan is transferred to a collection agency.</p><p>Defaulting on student loans can lead to severe consequences, including damage to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loans-impact-credit-score\">credit score</a>, wage garnishment, and having your tax refund withheld. You may also have to pay collection fees, court costs, and attorney’s fees if your lender takes you to court.</p><p>“When borrowers come to me, it’s often after they’ve already faced wage garnishment or collection notices,” says Christopher Migliaccio, a financial attorney at Warren and Migliaccio, LLP. “The first step is getting them to face the problem and contact their loan servicer or the Department of Education’s Default Resolution Group to understand their options.”</p><h2>When does a federal or private loan go into default?</h2><p>The timing of a student loan default depends on the type of loan you have. Federal student loans are considered in default after 270 days of missed payments. During that time, the loan is classified as delinquent, and you’ll receive multiple notices from your servicer before it officially enters default.</p><p>A private student loan default can happen much more quickly. Some lenders may declare your loan in default after just 90 days of missed payments, while others may wait longer. Because private lenders set their own terms, it’s important to check your loan agreement or contact your servicer directly to confirm the timeline.</p><p>Once a loan goes into default, it may be transferred to a collection agency. “At that point, your options become more limited, but it’s not too late to take action and start working toward getting your loan back in good standing,” says Migliaccio.</p><h2>What happens when you default on student loans?</h2><p>Once your student loans go into default, your servicer will begin taking steps to collect the balance you owe. For federal loans, this could result in wage garnishment and the withholding of your tax refunds. These funds are then applied toward your loan balance.</p><p>Private lenders generally must obtain a court judgment before garnishing wages, and they can’t take your tax refunds. But similar to federal loans, the entire loan balance becomes due immediately once you go into default.</p><p>If your lender is unable to collect on the debt, they’ll turn your private loans over to a collection agency. Not only will this seriously damage your credit, but the collection agency can sue you over the unpaid balance.</p><p>“Default doesn’t just affect your current finances — it can impact your ability to borrow or even get certain jobs in the future,” says Migliaccio. “But it’s important for borrowers to know they can recover. There are established programs, like default rehabilitation options and consolidation, that can help them get back on track.”</p><h2>How to get out of student loan default</h2><p>Once you’re in default, it can feel overwhelming, but the sooner you act, the more options you’ll have. Here’s how to start turning things around and rebuilding your finances.</p><h3>Verify your loan status and who holds the debt</h3><p>Start by confirming whether your loan is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/types-of-student-loans\">federal or private</a> and who currently owns it. This could be a loan servicer, the Department of Education, or a collection agency. For federal loans, contact your servicer or the Default Resolution Group to verify your account details.</p><h3>For federal loans, choose rehabilitation or consolidation</h3><p>Federal borrowers typically have two paths out of default:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-rehabilitation-vs-consolidation\">loan rehabilitation or consolidation</a>. According to Migliaccio, rehabilitation is best for those who can make steady, affordable payments since it removes the default from your credit report once complete.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/how-to-consolidate-student-loans\">Consolidation</a> works faster and restores eligibility for aid and income-driven repayment, but the default remains on your credit report.</p><h3>For private loans, contact your lender about relief options</h3><p>Private lenders set their own rules, but many are willing to work with you. Reach out to your lender and ask about hardship programs, modified payments, or settlements. If your account has been sent to collections, request all agreements in writing before making a payment.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:14518":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"14518","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:295122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"295122","content":"<h2>How to avoid default in the future</h2><p>Once you’ve brought your loans back into good standing, the next goal is to make sure you never end up in default again.

National Debt Relief credits this in part to their creditor relationships and knowledge of which types of debt are most likely to get settled.</li><li><strong>No upfront fees:</strong>&nbsp;You don’t pay National Debt Relief until they’ve successfully negotiated down your debt, you’ve agreed to it, and you’ve made your first payment. Note that you’ll continue to make payments based on the settlement agreement.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Fees:</strong>&nbsp;While debt settlement has the potential to save you money by reducing what you owe and eliminating years of interest accumulation, you’ll still have to pay National Debt Relief a fee. National Debt Relief charges up to 25% of the amount of enrolled debt that’s settled.</li><li><strong>Inherent risk:</strong>&nbsp;Consumer watchdog agencies like the FTC and CFPB say dealing with debt settlement companies like National Debt Relief is risky. Practices such as discouraging you from paying your credit card bills can lead to late fees, severe credit score damage, and more aggressive tactics from collections agencies. In some cases, a creditor may choose to sue you if you pursue debt settlement.</li><li><strong>No guarantee:</strong>&nbsp;Debt settlement companies cannot guarantee success. While National Debt Relief offers you some protections if its team is unsuccessful (you don’t pay unless they negotiate your debt down and you agree to it), you’ll be worse off than when you started since you theoretically stopped making payments on your debts while accruing additional fees and interest.</li><li><strong>Damage to your credit score:</strong>&nbsp;Because a part of the debt settlement process with National Debt Relief entails that you stop making payments on your outstanding debts, your credit score is likely to drop. When your debt is successfully settled, the account will be labeled as “settled” on your credit report (rather than paid), which can also impact your credit.</li><li><strong>Tax implications:</strong>&nbsp;Settled debt through National Debt Relief can be considered taxable income, meaning you’ll owe money to Uncle Sam on any savings you get.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;These advantages and disadvantages are not exclusive to National Debt Relief; you’ll encounter similar&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-settlement-pros-cons\">pros and cons of debt settlement</a> with other debt settlement companies.</p><h2>How to qualify for National Debt Relief</h2><p>Not everyone is eligible for debt settlement through National Debt Relief.

You’re not likely to win any negotiations if you aren’t that deep in the hole.</li><li><strong>Financial hardship:</strong>&nbsp;You’ll need to prove to National Debt Relief that you’re facing real financial hardship, such as a job loss, divorce, death of a spouse, medical issue, or massive tax bill. This strengthens your case with creditors.</li><li><strong>Ability to make monthly payments:</strong>&nbsp;National Debt Relief needs to ensure you can make monthly payments into the savings account they establish for you.

So, you’ll enjoy a fixed rate for 10 years, and then, depending on the term, your rate will change annually for the remaining five or 20 years.</p><h2>Pros and cons of a 10/1 ARM</h2><p>You could see a more affordable monthly payment with a 10/1 ARM at the outset of your loan, which might make homebuying more affordable. Refinancing before the 10-year fixed period could save you even more on interest as well.</p><p>On the other hand, if you don’t refinance your 10/1 ARM, you could potentially pay more in interest over time if rates rise, and your budget might strain as your monthly payment increases.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:217530":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"217530","content":"<h2>When to consider a 10/1 ARM</h2><p>A 10/1 ARM can be beneficial in certain situations:</p><ul><li><strong>Moving within 10 years:</strong> You might consider a 10/1 ARM if you think you’ll be moving before the rate adjusts. In this scenario, you may be able to find a lower initial rate and move before it adjusts.</li><li><strong>Paying off mortgage early:</strong> If you anticipate paying off your home loan ahead of time, this may be a good option. Look at several lenders and loan types to make sure it’s the best option to reach your payoff goal.</li><li><strong>Refinancing:</strong> This might benefit you if you’re planning to refinance within 10 years. If you’re banking on getting a lower interest rate in the next decade (as either your credit score or financial situation improves or interest rates drop), you might consider a 10/1 ARM.</li></ul><p>Before you commit to a 10/1 ARM, shop around and compare mortgage rates.

While you probably won’t apply for the actual mortgage until after you’ve had an offer accepted on a home, you could need proof that you’re likely to qualify before you even begin looking.</p><p>That’s where a pre-approval comes in. A pre-approval not only indicates that you’re likely to qualify for a mortgage loan but also how much you can borrow — crucial information to have when it’s time to set your homebuying budget or convince a seller that you can afford to buy their home.</p>"},"strapiPartnerComponentBlocksIcbMortgageWidgets:182":{"__typename":"strapiPartnerComponentBlocksIcbMortgageWidgets","id":"182","loanTerm":"PERIOD_FIXED_30YEARS","loanPurpose":"PURCH"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:6266":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"6266","content":"<h2>What is a mortgage pre-approval?</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">mortgage pre-approval</a> is a letter from a lender stating that you likely qualify for a mortgage loan. Unlike a prequalification, which relies on information you provide to the lender, a pre-approval is based on verified information about your income, debt, and credit history. It essentially tells you that unless your financial situation changes between now and closing, or derogatory information comes to light, the lender can probably approve you for a loan of up to the dollar amount shown on the pre-approval.</p><p>At the very least, a pre-approval demonstrates to your real estate agent, home sellers, and sellers’ agents that you’re serious about buying. More importantly, it shows how much you’re qualified to borrow and spend.</p><p>Remember, however, that a mortgage loan <i>pre</i>-approval is just that — it does not constitute a loan commitment or final loan approval. Those stages happen later in the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage\">mortgage application process</a>. The loan isn’t definitively approved until you’ve received the final approval and have been <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/closing-on-a-home\">cleared to close</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:10214":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"10214","content":"<h3>When should you apply for a mortgage pre-approval?</h3><p>The best time to apply for a mortgage pre-approval is as soon as you’ve made the decision to buy and are financially prepared to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-make-an-offer-on-a-house\">make an offer</a> when you find the right home.</p><p>You should have the pre-approval in hand before you ask to tour homes. Sellers and their agents often vet buyers to ensure that only those who’ve demonstrated the ability to purchase the home enter it, so starting your search without one will limit the homes you can tour.</p><p>Likewise, your buyer’s agent needs the pre-approval to know that you’re qualified to purchase and how much you can spend. While your agent might be willing to show you a home or two while the lender prepares your pre-approval, most sellers will not consider an offer that comes without one.</p><p>What it boils down to is that you’re not ready to tour homes until you get pre-approved for a mortgage because you’ll need the pre-approval to make an offer. Don’t wait too long to request one, though. Having to wait a couple of days to get your letter could allow another buyer to get their offer accepted before you’re even able to submit yours.</p><h2>How to get a mortgage pre-approval</h2><p>Getting a home loan pre-approval is similar to applying for a mortgage. Pre-approvals are actually <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">underwritten</a>, which means most of the lender’s work is finished by the time you apply for the loan.</p><p>Follow these steps to get a pre-approval:</p><ul><li>Select a lender. The easiest way to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/best-mortgage-lenders\">shop for loans and lenders</a> is to get pre-qualified rate quotes, whether from lenders’ websites or a rate-comparison site. Just make sure the lenders only do a soft credit inquiry, which doesn’t affect your credit score, when they process the request.</li><li>Gather the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval-documents\">documents</a> you’ll need for your pre-approval. The lender will give you specific instructions, but be prepared to submit the following:<ul><li>Most recent pay stub showing year-to-date earnings</li><li>Two most recent years’ worth of W-2s and 1099s</li><li>Two most recent months’ bank and investment account statements</li><li>Two most recent years’ tax returns</li><li>Credit card and loan statements</li></ul></li><li>Request a pre-approval for a home loan from your choice of lenders. Within a couple of days, you should receive a letter stating that you’ve been pre-approved for a home loan. The letter will include the type of loan and the term, as well as the loan and payment amount for which you’re pre-approved. The lender might also include conditions for final loan approval.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that showing sellers the full amount you’re qualified for can hurt your ability to negotiate if you <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-much-to-offer-on-a-house\">plan to offer less</a>. Your lender can issue you a letter showing any pre-approval amount you wish, up to the maximum for which you’re actually pre-approved.</p><h2>How long does a mortgage pre-approval last?</h2><p>Pre-approvals are usually good for anywhere from 30 days to 90 days, depending on the lender.</p><p>One reason pre-approvals expire is that your financial situation could change over time, which would mean the documentation you submitted is no longer accurate. You might have accumulated more debt, missed a payment, or withdrawn some of your cash reserves, for example.</p><p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">mortgage rates</a> and programs change over time. The rate your pre-approval shows might not be available several months down the road. Whereas decreasing rates might work in your favor, higher rates could reduce the loan amount you qualify for.</p><p>Of course, your situation could also improve over time. If you’ve <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/pay-off-debt\">paid down debt</a>, gotten a raise, or socked away extra savings, you could qualify for a larger loan or a better rate if you have to reapply for a pre-approval.</p><h2>What happens if you don’t buy a home before your pre-approval expires?</h2><p>What happens if your pre-approval expires before you buy a home depends on the lender. You’ll probably have to reapply, but the process will be easier this time because the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2022-06/applying-your-first-mortgage-loan\">lender will already have a lot of your information</a>. However, you’ll likely have to submit new bank statements, pay stubs, and, if it’s past tax day, your most recent tax return.</p><p>Some lenders might do another hard pull on your credit report when they process your new pre-approval application. It’s important to keep that in mind when you’re deciding when to apply for a pre-approval. Hard pulls coming more than two weeks apart can impact your credit score enough to disqualify you from getting the best rates, or even from getting a loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:272062":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"272062","content":"<p>If you're looking for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-origination-fee-personal-loan\">personal loan with no fees</a> and low interest rates, Discover personal loans are worth a look.

As a result, if you’re approved for a loan with bad credit, you’re likely to be offered an annual percentage rate (<a href=\"/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>) over 30%.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are bad credit loans and how do they work?</h2><p>A bad credit loan is any loan that you can potentially qualify for with bad credit. In this article, we focus on bad credit personal loans, which are a type of long-term installment loan. But many bad credit loans are short-term, high-fee loans that don’t require a credit check. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:</p><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\"><strong>Personal loans for bad credit</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These loans have APRs that top out at 36%; average rates for borrowers with bad credit are around 32% APR, but depend on the loan term you choose, your specific score, your income, current debt, and loan purpose. <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit\">Loan amounts</a> range from around $1,000 to $50,000, with repayment terms typically between 2 and 7 years. They often require a credit check and report to one or more of the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> PALs are available from federal credit unions; loan amounts are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms of up to 1 year. APRs are capped at 28%, making them an excellent option if you need a $2,000 loan or less and are (or can become) a member of a participating credit union. Many credit unions will not check your credit for a PAL.</li><li><strong>Small bank loans:</strong> Some banks, like Bank of America and <a href=\"/personal-loan/us-bank-personal-loans-review\">U.S. Bank</a>, offer small loans up to $500 or $1,000 to existing customers. These may have a short repayment period, such as 3 months, during which you’d pay the loan back in equal installments. Fees tend to be relatively low, and a credit check may not be required.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Use with caution</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Cash apps review your banking history to assess how much you’re eligible to borrow, though loan amounts are usually well under $1,000. Repayment is typically deducted from your checking account on your next payday. Though they may have no mandatory fees, cash advance apps tend to charge same-day funding fees and “optional” tips. Both can lead to triple-digit APRs — 367%, on average, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/401k-loan\"><strong>401(k) loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If your plan allows them, you may be able to borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Repayment terms are 5 years. There’s no credit check (it’s your money), and the interest you pay is low and goes into your account. However, you could lose out on years of market gains. And if you leave your job before the loan is paid back, it becomes due, in full, immediately. If you can’t pay it back, it’s treated as a distribution subject to income tax and an early withdrawal penalty.</li></ul><h3>Avoid</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Payday loans often get a bad rap — and for good reason. The typical payday loan has an APR of almost 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Like cash advance apps, this is due to the combination of high fees, small loan amounts, and very short repayment terms.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/car-title-loans\"><strong>Title loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A title loan is a secured loan where your vehicle's title is collateral. You can typically borrow a percentage of your car’s value, but if you fail to repay the loan, the lender can repossess your car. These loans often have very high interest rates and fees, making them a risky borrowing option.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\"><strong>Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A pawnshop loan is a short-term, secured loan where you borrow money by offering a valuable item as collateral. The pawnshop holds your item until you repay the loan with interest and fees — the amount of which could make the cost of borrowing equivalent to a triple-digit APR. If you fail to repay the loan, the pawnshop keeps the item and can sell it. The loan amount is typically a fraction of the item's value.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/what-is-a-bad-credit-personal-loan\">What Is a Bad Credit Loan?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289814":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289814","content":"<h2>How does credit affect your personal loan rate?</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">Your credit score</a> plays a major role in determining the APR you qualify for when you apply for a personal loan.

You can also use a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-credible-personal-loan\">personal loan marketplace</a> (like Credible) to compare minimum credit score requirements.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Prequalify</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Next, try to prequalify with multiple lenders to get a sense of which might approve your loan. Prequalification also estimates your rate, upfront fees, and how much you might be approved to borrow. Just note it’s not an offer of credit and the rates and terms of a loan offer may differ from prequalified quotes.</li><li><strong>Compare quotes:</strong> If you were able to prequalify (meaning, one or more lenders provided you with loan quotes), compare them to see which looks best. Consider each quote’s APR, whether an <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> is charged and how much, the loan amount, length of the repayment term, and monthly payment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compare lenders you prequalified with:</strong> Consider customer reviews on sites like Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau, as well as <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">funding times</a> between lenders and whether each charges other fees, like late fees. Make sure the lender reports payments to the credit bureaus.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\"><strong>Apply</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you’ve decided a personal loan is the way to go, apply with the lender that provided the best loan quote. Be ready to provide documentation, like pay stubs, to support your income and employment, plus a government ID. At this stage, most lenders perform a hard credit check, which could ding your score by up to 10 points for up to 1 year.</li><li><strong>Review the loan agreement:</strong> If approved, review the loan agreement before signing. Make sure the loan amount, repayment schedule, upfront fees, and APR are as expected.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Await funds:</strong> Once you’ve signed the agreement and other documents, the lender will send funds — either directly to your bank account or to your creditors (often an option if you’re getting a debt consolidation loan).&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans/how-to-get-a-bad-credit-loan\">How to Get a Bad Credit Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289838":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289838","content":"<h2>How to improve your credit score</h2><p>One of the best ways to get a loan with bad credit is to improve your credit score. The best way for long-lasting gains is to make your monthly payments on time and keep credit card balances low.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Consistently pay bills on time:</strong> Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, the most of any single factor. Set up automatic payments for recurring bills like car payments, credit cards, and personal loans. If a number of your bills are due around the same time each month, reach out to your creditors to change due dates for more breathing room.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/pay-off-debt\"><strong>Pay down debt</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The amount of debt you owe contributes 30% to your FICO score. Paying down debt, especially <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/how-much-credit-card-debt-too-much\">credit card debt</a>, can positively impact your credit and your ability to qualify for a personal loan.</li><li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> If you have a family member or close friend with good credit who’s willing to make you an authorized user on one of their credit cards, you can benefit from their good credit. The account would be entered on your <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-report\">credit report</a>, which means their history of positive payments and available credit would be as well. Both can significantly boost your credit score.</li><li><strong>Don’t close credit card accounts:</strong> Closing old credit card accounts with a zero balance may seem like a good idea, but it can drastically increase your credit utilization, which can hurt your credit. <a href=\"/personal-finance/what-is-credit-utilization\">Credit utilization</a> represents the amount of revolving credit you’re using relative to the amount available to you. Keeping accounts open once you’ve paid off balances can be a good way to keep your credit utilization ratio low and improve your score.</li><li><strong>Avoid hard inquiries:</strong> A <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard inquiry</a> often occurs when you formally apply for a loan. A lender may see you as a risk if you seek to borrow money multiple times from different sources within a short period of time. Applications for new credit make up 10% of your credit score.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">How To Build Your Credit: A Step-by-Step Guide&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Alternatives to bad credit personal loans</h2><p>Personal loans come with many advantages, but they’re not for everyone.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/family-loans\"><strong>Friends or family loan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> No matter the terms, put your agreement in writing, including the loan amount, interest or collateral, repayment period, and due dates.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\"><strong>Debt management plan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you’re drowning in debt, seek help from a nonprofit credit counseling agency.

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Flexible eligibility requirements</li><li>Offers secured options</li><li>Competitive bad-credit loans</li><li>Physical presence</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Availability</li><li>Origination fees</li><li>High starting APR</li><li>Low maximum loan amount</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$1,500 to $20,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</p><div><p>Origination fee, unsuccessful payment fee, late fee</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Discounts</p><div><p>None</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must have photo I.D. issued by U.S. federal, state or local government</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Min. income</p><div><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Customer service</p><div><p>Phone, email</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Soft credit check</p><div><p>Yes</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Time to get funds</p><div><p>As soon as 1 to 2 days after acceptance</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan use</p><div><p>All except business, and education</p></div></div></div></div></div><a class="LenderTableMoreDetails_readFullReview__0Peup styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_semiBold__25tTb styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../onemain-financial-personal-loans-review.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read full review</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-32"><span class="neutral disclaimer">All APRs reflect autopay and loyalty discounts where available</span><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../legal-pages/pl-general-disclosures.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Read more about Rates and Terms</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../terms.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Terms of Service</a><span class="neutral disclaimer"> | </span><a class="disclaimer secondary styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../../privacy.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Privacy Policy</a></div></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="best-personal-loans-with-a--credit-score">Best personal loans with a 550 credit score</h2></section><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

As a result, if you’re approved for a loan with bad credit, you’re likely to be offered an annual percentage rate (<a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">APR</a>) over 30%. </p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="what-are-bad-credit-loans-and-how-do-they-work">What are bad credit loans and how do they work?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A bad credit loan is any loan that you can potentially qualify for with bad credit. In this article, we focus on bad credit personal loans, which are a type of long-term installment loan. But many bad credit loans are short-term, high-fee loans that don’t require a credit check. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Recommended</h3><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../bad-credit-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Personal loans for bad credit</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> These loans have APRs that top out at 36%; average rates for borrowers with bad credit are around 32% APR, but depend on the loan term you choose, your specific score, your income, current debt, and loan purpose. <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get-with-bad-credit.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Loan amounts</a> range from around $1,000 to $50,000, with repayment terms typically between 2 and 7 years. They often require a credit check and report to one or more of the credit bureaus.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../payday-alternative-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> PALs are available from federal credit unions; loan amounts are available up to $2,000 with repayment terms of up to 1 year. APRs are capped at 28%, making them an excellent option if you need a $2,000 loan or less and are (or can become) a member of a participating credit union. Many credit unions will not check your credit for a PAL.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Small bank loans:</strong> Some banks, like Bank of America and <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../us-bank-personal-loans-review.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">U.S. Bank</a>, offer small loans up to $500 or $1,000 to existing customers. These may have a short repayment period, such as 3 months, during which you’d pay the loan back in equal installments. Fees tend to be relatively low, and a credit check may not be required. </li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Use with caution</h3><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../loan-apps.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> Cash apps review your banking history to assess how much you’re eligible to borrow, though loan amounts are usually well under $1,000. Repayment is typically deducted from your checking account on your next payday. Though they may have no mandatory fees, cash advance apps tend to charge same-day funding fees and “optional” tips. Both can lead to triple-digit APRs — 367%, on average, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../401k-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">401(k) loans</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> If your plan allows them, you may be able to borrow up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Some plans let you borrow up to $10,000 if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Repayment terms are 5 years. There’s no credit check (it’s your money), and the interest you pay is low and goes into your account. However, you could lose out on years of market gains. And if you leave your job before the loan is paid back, it becomes due, in full, immediately. If you can’t pay it back, it’s treated as a distribution subject to income tax and an early withdrawal penalty.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Avoid</h3><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../what-are-payday-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payday loans</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> Payday loans often get a bad rap — and for good reason. The typical payday loan has an APR of almost 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Like cash advance apps, this is due to the combination of high fees, small loan amounts, and very short repayment terms. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../car-title-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Title loans</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> A title loan is a secured loan where your vehicle&#x27;s title is collateral. You can typically borrow a percentage of your car’s value, but if you fail to repay the loan, the lender can repossess your car. These loans often have very high interest rates and fees, making them a risky borrowing option.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../pawn-shop-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">:</strong> A pawnshop loan is a short-term, secured loan where you borrow money by offering a valuable item as collateral. The pawnshop holds your item until you repay the loan with interest and fees — the amount of which could make the cost of borrowing equivalent to a triple-digit APR. If you fail to repay the loan, the pawnshop keeps the item and can sell it.

Millions of federal borrowers use income-driven repayment, which sets payments based on earnings and family size. That can lower monthly payments substantially, and in some cases reduce them to zero.

Interest rates\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA personal loan's \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\"\u003eannual percentage rate\u003c/a\u003e, or APR, accounts for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees. APR provides the most comprehensive way to measure the cost of borrowing money on an annualized basis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLenders typically charge between 6.49% and 35.99% APR for personal loans.

For lenders that do, these fees can increase your total repayment costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate fees are among the most common, but they only occur if you're late making a payment. Lenders usually give a grace period for missed payments before assessing a late fee, which is typically a flat fee or a percentage of your missed payment amount.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour lender may also impose an upfront fee, also called an origination fee, to offset their administrative fees or reduce their risk. Origination fees typically range from less than 1% to as much as 15% of the loan amount, and lenders generally deduct the fee from your loan upfront. So, if you borrow $95,000 with a 2% origination fee, you would receive $93,100.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLess common for personal loans is a prepayment penalty, which is a lender's charge for \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pay-off-loan-early\"\u003epaying off your loan early\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265850":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265850","content":"\u003ch3\u003e3.

These funds are then applied toward your loan balance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrivate lenders generally must obtain a court judgment before garnishing wages, and they can’t take your tax refunds. But similar to federal loans, the entire loan balance becomes due immediately once you go into default.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your lender is unable to collect on the debt, they’ll turn your private loans over to a collection agency.
