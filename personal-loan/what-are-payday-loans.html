You’ll also see your credit score drop if the collection agency reports your account to the credit bureaus.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a personal loan a good idea?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>If you need to borrow money for an essential expense, a personal loan can be a very good idea — especially if you need more than a few weeks or a month to pay it back. Personal loans, on average, have lower APRs than credit cards, and much lower APRs than short-term options like cash-advance apps and payday loans. If you’re struggling to qualify for a personal loan or want a lower rate, consider a secured personal loan or applying with a cosigner or with a co-borrower.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You may be able to get a personal loan if you have bad credit, or a FICO credit score less than 580. But if approved, the rate you’ll be offered will likely be high. Apply with lenders who require a minimum credit score that is lower than yours. To improve your application and, potentially, your APR, consider asking a close friend or family member with good credit to be a cosigner or a co-borrower or apply for a secured loan.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A good interest rate on a personal loan depends primarily on your credit score. If you have fair credit (a FICO score between 669 and 580) or poor credit (a score under 580), you’ll likely qualify for a higher interest rate than if you have good credit. For instance, APRs for borrowers with FICO scores above 780 averaged 15.56% on five-year personal loans, while APRs for borrowers with scores between 600 and 639 were 29.94%, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Credible data</a>.&nbsp;</p>"}}]}

It helps the college or university of your choice determine if you're eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/pell-grant-calculator-and-eligibility\">Pell Grants</a> and other financial aid.</p><p>Your SAI is determined by the information you, along with your parents or guardians (if applicable), provide on the FAFSA. After the FAFSA is complete, you'll be assigned an SAI between -1,500 and 999,999. Lower SAIs translate to higher financial need.</p><p>The SAI replaced the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-calculate-your-student-loan-expected-family-contribution-efc\">Expected Family Contribution</a> (EFC) as part of the FAFSA Simplification Act and was first used during the 2024-25 award year.</p><p>“The new formula expanded access to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/fafsa-how-much\">federal aid</a> and increased the number of students eligible for Pell Grants,” says Bethany Coleman, vice president of public relations, communications, and marketing in the Office of Public Information at the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency.</p><p>However, Coleman also cited potential adverse effects, which we'll highlight below.</p><h2>What does a high Student Aid Index mean?</h2><p>Generally speaking, a high Student Aid Index indicates a lower need for financial aid, based on the assumption that the student and/or their parents can cover the cost of tuition and related expenses.</p><p>If you have a higher SAI, you may find you're eligible for less aid (or no aid). A negative SAI means you have a greater need for aid, but there's no specific number that designates the threshold between high and low. And a high SAI at one school may not be considered so at another university.</p><p>Barbara Schmitt, director of financial aid at King's College, notes that “the SAI, just like the EFC, is the one number that comes out when you do your FAFSA,” adding, \"it doesn't matter if you go to a local community college or Ivy League school, that SAI stays the same.\"</p><p>To show why this matters, Schmitt used an example of a student with a 15,000 SAI.</p><p>“If they go to their local community college, which has a lower tuition, they may only be eligible for student loans. They may not be eligible for federal Pell Grants and they may or may not be eligible for state <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>,” she says. But she highlights the fact that if they go to a higher-priced school, “that would be considered a low SAI because it depends upon the cost of attendance.”</p><p>In other words, you may find that an SAI that bars you from receiving aid at one school meets the eligibility requirements for grants or institutionally backed aid at another school.</p><h3>The SAI and federal student loan eligibility</h3><p>It's important to keep in mind that there's more to a school's aid package than SAI-driven grants and scholarships. Depending on your financial circumstances, you may also be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/must-borrow-college-start-subsidized-student-loans\">subsidized federal student loans</a>.</p><p>There's an indirect relationship between the two, however. Schmitt offers another example:</p><p>“Let's say the tuition at a specific school is $60,000, and a student has a 30,000 SAI and is eligible for a $27,000 scholarship,” she says. “The $27,000 is deducted from the 30,000 SAI, leaving a need of $3,000. If the student received another scholarship for $1,000, the total need would be reduced to $2,000.”</p><p>“The maximum federal loan amount (subsidized or not) a dependent freshman can get is $5,500 combined,” she notes. “The most out of that $5,500 that can be subsidized is $3,500. In this scenario, the student is only eligible for $2,000 of a subsidized loan and not the full $3,500,” says Schmitt.</p><h2>How is the Student Aid Index calculated?</h2><p>The SAI is based on information from the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">FAFSA</a>, which includes information about both the student and their parents, also referred to as “contributors.” Primarily, this information includes:</p><ul><li>Student and contributor tax returns</li><li>Student and contributor Social Security numbers</li><li>Cash and account balances, including checking and savings accounts</li><li>Net worth of any investments and bank statements</li><li>Any untaxed income</li><li>Household size</li></ul><p>Note that in the case of divorce, financial information about a parent's spouse may also be included in the calculation.</p><p>Further, Schmitt notes that in some cases, the new SAI calculation also changes who's defined as the contributing parent. This is particularly true for parents who are divorced or not married and living in separate houses, where one parent contributes more financial support, such as through child support, than the other.</p><p>“It's not the custodial parent like it used to be. It's the parent who provides the most support,” she notes. If you're unsure which parent is the contributor, Schmitt suggests using the “<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents\">Who counts as a parent on the FAFSA form?</a>” tool available on StudentAid.gov.</p><p>Once financial resources are tallied, annual living expenses are deducted, and the remaining balance is considered the amount of money a family can reasonably contribute to higher education costs.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:213658":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"213658","content":"<h2>What to do if you have a high SAI and need more aid</h2><p>If your SAI is too high and you need more aid, there are a few things you can do.</p><h3>Ensure FAFSA information accurately reflects current finances</h3><p>Schmitt notes that SAI is based on income from two years prior. For instance, if you're filling out a FAFSA for the 2025-26 school year, the information used to determine the SAI is based on the 2023 tax year.</p><p>“A lot can change in two years,” she adds.</p><h3>File an appeal</h3><p>If you feel your SAI does not accurately reflect your needs, you can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/financial-aid-appeal-letter\">file an appeal</a> with the school you plan to attend.</p><p>Common reasons to file an appeal may include:</p><ul><li>Death of a parent</li><li>Job loss or job change that resulted in lower income</li><li>A natural disaster that led to the loss of a home</li><li>Divorce or loss of child support</li><li>Increased family size</li></ul><p>Schmitt points to those situations as conditions under which your school can make a “professional judgment decision” about your SAI and your current family circumstances.</p><p>“If a family's circumstances have changed, even if they're not sure how dramatically [they] changed or if the change will make any difference for them, they should always reach out to the financial aid office at their school,” she recommends.</p><p>If approved, the school can update the FAFSA figures on your behalf, noting that the federal government should base your financial need on the most current figures rather than those that were automatically leveraged when you filed the FAFSA.</p><p>Schmitt is also quick to point out that families should go directly to the school and not the Department of Education, as once the SAI is determined, the school is your only line of defense at that point.</p><h3>Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Need-based grants and scholarships can help take the financial burden off of families trying to cover the cost of higher education, but they aren't the only options.</p><p>“Students should explore other non-need-based aid types like merit-based scholarships,” recommends Coleman. “We always stress FREE MONEY FIRST!”</p><p>Merit-based scholarships, such as those for academic, athletic, or artistic excellence, are one way to pay for school, but there are plenty of other <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships for college</a>, too. Students may be eligible for scholarships based on where they live, organizations they or a parent are members of, degree paths they choose, or even hobbies they pursue.</p><p>To find scholarships, you should check with your high school's guidance office and your college or university of choice, as well as local businesses and organizations, and online databases.</p><h3>Consider federal student loans</h3><p>Students with a high SAI may not be eligible for subsidized federal student loans, or their eligibility may not meet their total need. However, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">unsubsidized federal loans</a> are not need-dependent, so you should explore your other federal loan options to determine if one makes sense.</p><h3>Explore private student loan options</h3><p>If you've exhausted all options and federal loans won't cover all of your expenses, consider looking for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>.

Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

Condos often cost less than single-family homes and you don’t have to worry about maintenance or repairs.</p><p>Here are some of the main advantages to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/buying-a-condo\">buying a condo</a>:</p><h3>Costs less than a single-family home</h3><p>One of the main draws of owning a condo is price. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price of a condo was $339,400 in January 2024, while the median price of a single-family home was $383,500.</p><p>With home inventory at a record-low level and prices continuing to surge, more investors may see condos as an appealing, cost-effective option.</p><h3>Offers a variety of amenities</h3><p>For those interested in communal living, condos offer attractive amenities. Many condo communities include grilling areas, gyms, pools, and other common areas. These attractive amenities can make it easier to find renters for a condo or guests for an Airbnb.</p><h3>Doesn’t require external maintenance and repairs</h3><p>Condo fees are relatively low given that you aren’t responsible for all of the maintenance and repairs.</p><p>With a single-family home, you’re responsible for maintaining the roof, patio, gutters, paint, and every other part of your house. But with condos, you pay your regular fee and the homeowners association takes care of the external upkeep — including snow removal, yard work, and other exterior maintenance. This can make things easier for a beginning investor.</p><h3>Appreciates in value while providing cash flow</h3><p>A condo can provide cash flow, whether you rent it out or use it for Airbnb. While receiving this cash flow, the condo also <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-increase-home-value\">appreciates in value</a> over time, increasing your equity.</p><h2>Drawbacks to investing in a condo</h2><p>While convenient and cheaper than single-family homes, condos come with their share of drawbacks, too. HOA fees and rental restrictions are just a few disadvantages you might be leery of as an investor and condo owner.</p><p>Here are some of the main drawbacks to buying a condo:</p><h3>Association fees</h3><p>Depending on the location, condo association fees can be high — from a few hundred dollars a month to a thousand dollars (or even more). Additionally, hefty monthly condo fees increase your payment, cutting into your overall return on investment.</p><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Learn as much as you can about the condo’s HOA before you buy rental property there. Ask to see the HOA’s finances to find out whether it has sufficient cash reserves. If the HOA doesn’t have an adequate reserve fund, it might have to increase dues or impose special assessments to cover certain renovations or replenish that empty reserve — both of which cost you money.</p><h3>Rental restrictions</h3><p>Not every condo community allows you to rent out the condo. Or, you might be able to rent it out to long-term renters, but not be able to use it for short-term rentals like Airbnb. If you plan on renting out your unit, be sure to understand the limitations.</p><h3>Association restrictions</h3><p>In addition to rental restrictions, there might be other restrictions in a condo community. Your homeowner's association might limit the types of modifications you can make to the unit or the number of pets you can own.</p><p>For some investors, these restrictions can be a deal breaker.</p><h3>Difficulty in obtaining financing for a condo</h3><p>It can be harder to get financing for a condo. Condo mortgage rates tend to be higher than rates for single-family homes, and the lender might have other conditions, like expecting a certain number of units in a community to be owner-occupied (i.e., there are more owners than renters) before offering you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">pre-approval</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:12722":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"12722","content":"<p><img src=\"https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/How_to_get_a_loan_for_a_condo_infographic_695f6635e9.png\" alt=\"How-to-get-a-loan-for-a-condo_-infographic.png\" srcset=\"https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/thumbnail_How_to_get_a_loan_for_a_condo_infographic_695f6635e9.png 245w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/small_How_to_get_a_loan_for_a_condo_infographic_695f6635e9.png 500w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/medium_How_to_get_a_loan_for_a_condo_infographic_695f6635e9.png 750w,https://www.credible.com/assets/cms/large_How_to_get_a_loan_for_a_condo_infographic_695f6635e9.png 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\"></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:12726":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"12726","content":"<h2>Should you invest in a condo?</h2><p>Before investing in a condo, carefully think about your situation and money goals, and weigh the pros and cons.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:12730":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"12730","content":"<p>If you want to start investing in condos, make sure that you’re choosing a location that’s likely to provide a good rate of appreciation.</p><p>Consider how much time you want to spend on maintenance and repairs, too.

For instance, you may have up to 90 days from your termination date to repay the loan in full.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, the unpaid amount becomes a plan distribution, which is taxable. Plus, if you took out the loan before you turned 59½, you could owe a 10% early withdrawal penalty on any unpaid amount as well.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267114":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267114","content":"<h3>401(k) loan vs. 401(k) withdrawal</h3><p>A 401(k) loan is when you borrow money from your 401(k) with the intention of returning it, typically via regular payroll deductions. Removing money from your 401(k) without the intention of paying it back is a 401(k) withdrawal, also referred to as a distribution. These funds remain permanently removed from your account.&nbsp;</p><p>401(k) withdrawals are usually subject to a tax penalty of 10% if you’re under 59½ plus income tax. But there are exceptions. For example, you can take a 401(k) hardship withdrawal — a maximum of $1,000 — penalty-free once annually to pay for an emergency personal expense. Some plans also allow withdrawals for qualified birth, adoption, or medical expenses. Though you may avoid an early withdrawal penalty in these cases, your withdrawal would still be taxable according to your income tax rate.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does a 401(k) loan work?</h2><p>A 401(k) loan has specific rules on borrowing limits and repayments. Understanding the risks of borrowing against your 401(k) can help you decide if it’s a good option.</p><h3>Policies</h3><p>Most 401(k) policies differ between companies. “Some companies allow multiple loans at once, others cap borrowing at one loan at a time,” says Chris Heerlein, chief executive officer of REAP Financial. Your policy’s loan interest rate and repayment terms can vary from one employer to the next, too. Before borrowing, read your policy and ask your employer about restrictions on using your loan funds and what happens with your loan if you take a leave of absence or leave the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Borrowing limits</h3><p>The most you can borrow from a 401(k) plan is $50,000. But you can’t borrow this amount unless you have at least $100,000 vested in your account. This is because you're limited to borrow up to half of your vested balance. The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000. For example, if you only have $15,000 vested in your 401(k), you could borrow up to $10,000.&nbsp;</p><p>These borrowing limits are the same even if your 401(k) plan allows multiple loans at once.&nbsp;</p><p>Say you have a vested 401(k) balance of $60,000. Per the IRS, you’d be allowed to borrow up to $30,000, or 50% of your vested balance. (Keep in mind, your 401(k) plan would need to allow 401(k) loans.)&nbsp;</p><p>Let's also say that you already took out a loan for $20,000 and have repaid $10,000 of it (you still owe $10,000). Now, you want to borrow a second 401(k) loan. You’d be allowed to borrow up to $20,000, since half of your vested balance is $30,000, and the two loans would total $30,000.</p><h3>401(k) loan interest rate and fees</h3><p>Some 401(k) plans charge fees for your loan. This may be a one-time fee for establishing your loan, usually between $50 and $100. Some plan administrators may also charge a loan application fee and an annual maintenance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also pay interest on a 401(k) loan based on the current prime rate. However, the interest you pay goes back into your account. “Essentially, the interest payment is like moving money from your left pocket to your right pocket,” says Andrew Hall, certified financial planner, wealth advisor, and vice president of Farther, a wealth management platform.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267118":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267118","content":"<h3>Repayment&nbsp;</h3><p>Like other types of loans, you’ll repay a 401(k) loan over time with interest. Most plans require you to repay your loan in full within five years, although your repayment term may be extended if you’re using the funds to buy a home as your primary residence. You’ll also need to make payments at least once per quarter.&nbsp;</p><h3>Changing jobs</h3><p>If you leave your job when you have an outstanding 401(k) loan, you’ll need to repay the loan in full. This can happen if you quit or get terminated. If you can’t pay it off, your employer will treat it as a 401(k) withdrawal, meaning you’ll be taxed and charged the 10% distribution penalty if you’re under the age of 59½. For example, you may have up to 90 days after your termination date to pay back the outstanding balance in full.</p><h3>Retirement growth</h3><p>When you take out a 401(k) loan, the amount borrowed does not participate in market gains (or losses). “While you’re technically borrowing from yourself, the real cost is lost growth,” says Heerlein, who had a client take out a $30,000 401(k) loan and pay it back over five years. “The market performed well during that period, and had they left the money invested, it could have grown by tens of thousands. They repaid the loan, but the lost compounding set them back years.”</p><p>Plus, some plans may not allow you to contribute to your 401(k) while you have an outstanding loan. If this is the case and your plan includes employer-matching contributions, you could also lose out on thousands of dollars of “free” money (contributed by your employer) over the term of your 401(k) loan.&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, borrowing from your 401(k) can provide short-term financial relief but potentially leave you without as much of a retirement cushion later on.</p><h3>Credit impact&nbsp;</h3><p>A 401(k) loan doesn’t require a credit check, and neither the loan itself nor your payments will be reported to credit bureaus. Even if you don’t repay the loan, it won’t appear on your credit report. So, in terms of impacting your credit, a 401(k) loan carries little risk.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:267122":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"267122","content":"<h3>401(k) loans vs personal loans</h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a> doesn’t affect your retirement savings like a 401(k) loan.

New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month.

However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

How you repay the advance depends on the app.</li><li>Apps usually allow you to take another advance once your previous advance is paid off.</li></ol><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Instant money apps have different rules for cash advance eligibility.

The free option usually sends your cash at least a day after your request is approved, with some apps taking as long as five days. The paid option typically gives you access to the fastest funding times, but can be the most expensive way to borrow. For example, Tilt offers instant transfers for free to Tilt debit cards, but charges an $8 monthly subscription fee. Chime only charges $2 for instant delivery, and transfers within 24 hours are free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-personal-loan\">How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?</a></p><h2>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advances can be helpful if you're in a tight financial spot, they aren't meant to be something you continually rely on to cover your expenses, said Dr. Severine Bryan, founder of financial education and coaching company Sev Talks Money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319326":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319326","content":"<p>If you need to borrow money but don't want to use cash advance apps, you have several other options.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs.

Examples of this include <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/financing-a-duplex\">a duplex</a> or small apartment building. Each unit has its own kitchen and bathroom, but the residents typically share walls, a roof, laundry space, and the surrounding yard.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Rental income:</strong> These buildings are typically owned by one person who lives in one unit and rents out the others. If you own the building, the rental income can offset the cost of your mortgage.</li><li><strong>Ideal for multigenerational families: </strong>This is a great option if you want to live near family members but still retain privacy.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Less privacy compared to single-family homes: </strong>Because you’re sharing walls, a roof, and a yard, you may hear your neighbors and run into them more often.</li><li><strong>Potential for vacancies:</strong> Owning the building comes with perks, but any temporary vacancies will cost you money. You’ll need to make sure you have emergency savings for this possibility.</li></ul><h3>How to pay for it</h3><p>If the multi-family home has up to four units, it’s considered residential for the purpose of financing. That means you can buy the property using the same type of mortgage as you would for a single-family home, including conventional and government-backed loans.</p><h2>New construction home</h2><p><strong>Best if: </strong>You want to customize a brand-new dwelling</p><p>A new construction home is just what it sounds like: a brand-new home with the most up-to-date building standards. You can either purchase your own land and contract with a builder to customize your abode, or you can select a move-in-ready home designed by the homebuilder.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Control over the process: </strong>Depending on what your builder offers, you might be able to customize everything from the size of the home, where it’s located, how it’s laid out, and all of the building materials.</li><li><strong>No bidding wars: </strong>You won’t have to worry about <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-make-an-offer-on-a-house\">submitting an offer</a> and competing with other homebuyers, which is especially useful in a market with limited inventory.</li><li><strong>New materials: </strong>Newer homes are usually more energy-efficient and built to meet current building codes. And because everything is brand-new, you won’t need to worry about making too many repairs or replacements like you would on a fixer-upper.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Waiting period:</strong> It takes nearly seven months on average to build a one-unit home, so you’ll need to find a place to live in the meantime and potentially field questions from the builder throughout this period.</li><li><strong>Unexpected costs:</strong> It’s a good idea to budget for unexpected costs and price increases that might drive up your ultimate home purchase price.</li><li><strong>No negotiating: </strong>The builder you work with might offer set prices, leaving you less room to negotiate costs.</li></ul><h3>How to pay for it</h3><p>There are two ways to finance the purchase of a new construction home:</p><ol><li>Use a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/construction-loan\">construction loan</a> to finance the building of the home.</li><li>Take out a traditional home loan to buy a new construction home.</li></ol><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/mortgage/how-to-get-a-mortgage\">How To Get a Mortgage</a></p><h2>Condo</h2><p><strong>Best if:</strong> You want to use shared services and amenities and don’t want to deal with home maintenance</p><p>A <a href=\"/mortgage/buying-a-condo\">condo</a>, or condominium, is a single unit within a multi-unit building or property. Residents often share amenities such as a laundry room, pool, dog-walking area, and fitness center.</p><p>A condo association collects monthly fees from the residents and uses the money to maintain the property and shared areas.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Affordability: </strong>Condos are generally cheaper than buying a single-family home.</li><li><strong>Shared amenities:</strong> Some condo associations offer amenities and social opportunities to meet neighbors.</li><li><strong>Security: </strong>Condo associations may also hire security guards to patrol the grounds, which may make the neighborhood safer.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>HOA fees: </strong>While the cost of the condo unit could be more affordable than a single-family home, you’ll typically need to pay monthly condo fees that range from a couple of hundred dollars to more than a thousand dollars per month.</li><li><strong>Restrictions: </strong>Condo associations usually set rules that members have to follow.</li><li><strong>Potentially harder to sell:</strong> Because condo living isn’t a good fit for everyone, you may have a more limited pool of prospective buyers should you sell your property.</li></ul><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/are-condos-a-good-investment\">Are Condos a Good Investment? Figuring Out the Pros and Cons</a></p><h3>How to pay for it</h3><p>You can use conventional loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/fha-approved-condos\">FHA condo loans</a>, and VA condo loans to purchase a condo. But it might be harder to qualify, relative to a single-family home, because the mortgage lender will scrutinize the health of the condo project itself in addition to your own finances.</p><p>The details vary with each mortgage program, so ask a lender to walk you through your options.</p><h2>Townhouse</h2><p><strong>Best if: </strong>You want the amenities of a condo but also prefer to own the land where the townhouse is built</p><p>A townhouse is a unit within a multi-unit property. These are usually composed of several floors and may include a garage and a small yard.</p><p>Residents often share walls and a roof, and there may also be shared common areas like pools, dog-walking areas, and fitness centers. You’ll pay a monthly fee to the homeowners association to cover the maintenance.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Amenities: </strong>Townhouse residents may have access to amenities such as pools, gyms, and dog-walking areas.</li><li><strong>Land ownership: </strong>If the townhouse comes with a yard, you’ll own the land. Even better, the HOA might include landscaping and pest control.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Less privacy: </strong>Because you’re sharing walls and backyard space with other neighbors, there’s inherently less privacy compared to a single-family home.</li><li><strong>Restrictions: </strong>Townhouse residents typically must follow the rules set forth by the HOA. For instance, you might need to get permission to do major renovations and follow guidelines about decorating the exterior, and you might not be able to own certain pets.</li></ul><h3>How to pay for it</h3><p>You can use a conventional loan or government-backed mortgage to buy a townhouse, but the lender may need to evaluate the financial health of the homeowners association.</p><h2>Co-op</h2><p><strong>Best if:</strong> You’re buying in a large city</p><p>When you buy a co-op, you’re not actually buying a piece of property. Instead, you become a shareholder in a corporation that owns a multi-unit building. The shares entitle you to lease one of the units.</p><p>Co-ops are popular in urban areas, such as Washington, D.C., and New York City, and require a monthly maintenance fee for upkeep.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>More options:</strong> In some large cities, co-ops provide an alternative to condos and townhomes that might be more affordable.</li><li><strong>Participation:</strong> Because you’re a shareholder in a corporation, you'll get a say in how the building or complex is run, even if you're not on the board.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Tough approval process: </strong>You’ll need to sit through an interview where the co-op board asks about your job, hobbies, lifestyle, and plans for renovations. When you later sell your co-op shares, you might have trouble finding a suitable buyer who also passes the test.</li><li><strong>Rules and regulations:</strong> You’ll have to abide by the co-op’s rules, which might limit everything from your ability to remodel your unit to your plans for renting out your property.</li></ul><h3>How to pay for it</h3><p>You won’t use a traditional mortgage loan to buy a co-op since you don’t actually own your unit. Instead, you’ll need to find a bank or other lending institution that offers “co-op loans” or “share loans,” which allow you to purchase shares in the cooperative.</p><p>The lender will typically want to check the financial health of the co-op and see how it operates.</p><h2>Questions to ask yourself when choosing a home</h2><p>Every type of home comes with its own pros and cons. To figure out which one is right for you, ask yourself these questions:</p><h3>1. How much space do I need?</h3><p>If you need lots of room to accommodate a growing family (or a dog), consider a single-family home or townhouse.</p><p>These tend to offer the most space because you’ll have a yard and garage. But it’s always a good idea to compare square footage; it’s always possible one condo offers more space than a nearby single-family house.</p><h3>2. Do I want the freedom to renovate?</h3><p>If your single-family home is situated within a homeowners association, you might need to follow a few rules about exterior maintenance.</p><p>But generally, you have much more flexibility to personalize a single-family house compared to other types of dwellings. Homeowners association rules for condos, co-ops, and townhouses tend to be much stricter.</p><h3>3. Am I willing to pay additional fees?</h3><p>Residents who live in co-ops, condos, and townhouses typically pay a monthly fee that covers services for their residents. These services vary with every HOA, but they might include utilities, landscaping, pest control, pools, gyms, parks, playgrounds, and other amenities.</p><p>The monthly fee also varies with each HOA, ranging from a few hundred dollars to more than $1,000.</p><h3>4. Will I want to refinance in the future?</h3><p>While you might think you scored a great deal on a mortgage, it’s always a good idea to look for future savings. The <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-refinance-your-mortgage\">process of refinancing</a> a single-family home, condo, or townhouse is pretty straightforward. You’ll apply for a new mortgage, pay off the original loan, and pay down the new loan over time.</p><p>Homeowners usually do this when they can save money or if they need to borrow cash.</p><p>But you’ll have to go through more steps to refinance if you live in a co-op. You’ll need to find a lender that offers co-op <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage-refinance\">refinance loans</a>, and the co-op board will have to approve your request.</p><h3>5. How much can I afford?</h3><p>Getting a <a href=\"/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">pre-approval</a> is one way to find out how much you can spend on a home. During this process, a lender will review your credit history, bank statements, and income to figure out how much you can put toward housing expenses per month.</p><p>Single-family, new-construction, and multi-family homes may cost more than condominiums. However, you’ll need to make sure you can fit any condo association fees into your budget if you decide to buy one of these dwellings.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:231666":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"231666","content":"<p>If you’ve filed for bankruptcy, it can have a lasting impact on your credit — depending on the type of bankruptcy, it could be on your report, lowering your score, for seven to 10 years.

If you find mistakes, <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/disputing-errors-your-credit-reports\">contact the credit bureau</a> and dispute them before applying for a loan.</li><li><strong>Know your loan amount:</strong> A personal loan can be helpful, but it still needs to be repaid. That means borrowing within your means and only for what you need. Personal loan lenders generally offer loan amounts from <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a> to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a>, but some offer loans up to or over <a href=\"/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a>. If you’re approved for a loan, it will be for an amount the lender feels confident you can pay back.</li><li><strong>Research lenders:</strong> Just like borrowers, lenders differ. So <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">research personal loans and lenders</a> — look at minimum and maximum loan amounts, eligibility requirements, APRs, repayment terms, fees, and customer reviews.</li><li><strong>Get prequalified:</strong> Once you have your list of potential lenders, see if you can get prequalified online. You may see a “check your rate” button on the lender’s site or a loan marketplace, which usually refers to the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalification process</a>. You’ll provide basic personal information and, within a few minutes, find out if you’re likely to be approved and at what rate. Prequalification doesn’t impact your credit score, but applying for a loan (like any form of credit) could lower your score by a few points for up to a year.</li><li><strong>Submit personal loan application:</strong> If you’ve prequalified, you should have a better idea of your best options. <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">Submit your personal loan application</a> and have pay stubs, tax statements, and bank statements ready to support your application. After that, it’s in the lender’s hands.

Use the remaining amount to determine what you can afford for monthly payments, as well as how much you can save for a down payment. A <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">mortgage affordability calculator</a> can help you set a budget.</li><li><strong>Do a credit check: </strong>Your credit history and credit score will play a major part in your loan application, so request a copy of your credit report and review it ahead of time. If you have late payments, collection efforts, or other negative events on your report, address those before you apply, as they could hurt your chances. Plus, if there are any fraudulent accounts or errors in your report, you can dispute them with the reporting credit bureau.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved:</strong> It helps to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">get pre-approved for a mortgage</a> before searching for a home. When you apply for pre-approval, the lender reviews your credit history and borrower profile and gives you a letter describing the loan terms and amounts you’re likely to be approved for later. A pre-approval letter can give you a good price range to shop in and give sellers more confidence when you make offers.</li><li><strong>Compare rates and mortgage offers:</strong> Next, you’ll want to compare options. Pay close attention to the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/apr-vs-interest-rate\">interest rate and APR</a> you’re being offered, the closing costs, and any fees the lender is charging.</li><li><strong>Find and make an offer on a home: </strong>When you find a home you want to buy, submit your pre-approval letter with your offer, and work with an experienced real estate agent to get the best deal.</li><li><strong>Complete the full mortgage application: </strong>After your offer has been accepted, fill out your lender’s full mortgage application and submit the documentation it requires, such as tax returns, bank statements, and pay stubs. You will also need to agree to a credit check.</li><li><strong>Await approval: </strong>Your loan will then go into <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-long-does-underwriting-take\">underwriting</a>, which is when your lender verifies your income, savings, and other assets and makes sure you can repay the loan. The lender will also order an appraisal to gauge the home’s value (and make sure it’s worth the money you’re requesting to borrow for it).</li><li><strong>Get ready for closing: </strong>Once your loan is nearing full approval, you’ll get a closing date, which is when you’ll sign the final paperwork and receive your keys. You’ll typically need proof of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/home-insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need\">homeowners insurance</a> by this day, so be sure to shop around for your policy early.</li><li><strong>Close on your loan: </strong>When closing day rolls around, you’ll attend your appointment and sign the required paperwork.

Compare lenders</h3><p>Immigrants looking for personal loans should <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">compare multiple lenders</a> to find the best possible terms. Start with each lender's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">annual percentage rate</a> (APR), the annual cost of borrowing that accounts for interest rates and any upfront lender fees, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a>. Also consider the length of the repayment term, how long it will take to fund the loan, and any minimum credit score or income requirements.</p><h3>2. Prequalify for a loan</h3><p>Research personal loan lenders that approve loans for immigrants. You can use a personal loan marketplace to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify with multiple lenders</a> and choose the best option for your situation.</p><h3>3. Gather documentation and personal information</h3><p>This typically includes:</p><ul><li>Identification, such as a driver’s license</li><li>Proof of address</li><li>Contact information</li><li>Social Security number (SSN) or other identifying information</li></ul><h4>Proof of income and job status</h4><p>Some lenders have a minimum income requirement while others don’t — but in either case, you’ll still generally need to show proof of income.

Submit your application</h3><p>Submit your application online through the lender's website.</p><p>When you apply for a personal loan, you’ll typically need to authorize a hard credit check so the lender can decide whether to offer a loan and at what rate and terms.

Review the loan agreement and sign</h3><p>If you've been approved for a personal loan, review the loan agreement closely before signing. Make sure the loan's APR, monthly payment, repayment schedule, and any upfront fees are acceptable.

Research lenders and loan options</h2><p>Before applying for a personal loan, make sure to thoroughly research your loan options. There are many <a href=\"/personal-loan\">highly rated personal loan lenders</a>, and it’s important to find one that best meets your needs.</p><p>When choosing a lender, there are generally <a href=\"/personal-loan/where-can-i-get-a-personal-loan\">three types to choose from</a>: <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">traditional banks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>. Each of these options has its own pros and cons. A traditional bank or credit union could be a good option if you already have a relationship with that financial institution, such as having your accounts there or having previously borrowed from them.</p><p>Online lenders also have some major advantages. Because they don’t have physical locations, their overhead tends to be lower, which can result in lower fees and interest rates for borrowers. Additionally, some have more lenient eligibility requirements and offer loans to borrowers with poor or fair credit.</p><p>It’s helpful to decide ahead of time what you need when it comes to your loan amount and repayment term, as well as your credit score and your desired APR. Knowing these factors upfront can help you narrow down your lender options quickly.</p><h2>4. Prequalify with multiple lenders</h2><p>Many lenders allow you to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a personal loan</a>, meaning you’ll go through a soft credit check to determine whether you’re likely to qualify for a loan and what your estimated APR, amounts, and terms are.&nbsp;</p><p>Because prequalification doesn’t negatively affect your credit score, it presents an opportunity to shop around with different lenders to see which could offer the best option for you.

The Association of American Publishers’ “Trends in Student Spending on Course Materials” report found that spending on textbooks and course materials dropped by more than 45% in the last decade. A big reason for this decline is the rise of new formats, such as online texts and assistance programs.</p><p>“Colleges typically include the estimated cost of books in the published cost of attendance figures, but that can represent buying or renting textbooks,” says Jack Wang, wealth adviser and host of the Smart College Buyer podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>“If a family wants more specifics, they may have to reach out to the individual academic departments for details, as books and the availability of digital access can vary significantly from class to class.”</p><p>Because costs vary so much, it can be difficult to plan ahead.

After your financial aid award is applied to tuition, mandatory fees, and housing, any leftover funds can generally be used for other education costs, including textbooks and supplies.&nbsp;</p><p>Schools that participate in the federal aid program must give students a way to access books and supplies by the first week of each term.

Check with your school’s financial aid office to see if similar programs are available.</p><p>Certain private scholarships also include textbook stipends, giving recipients extra funds to cover course materials.

Examples of programs that can lead to significant student debt include MBAs, law school, and medical and dental school. For some borrowers, enrolling in a prestigious school or pursuing a traditionally high-paying profession might feel like a catch-22 due to student loan debt.</p><p>Additionally, interest is charged on the remaining unpaid loan balance over time.

The first is through income-driven repayment.</p><p>After making all payments under an IDR plan, borrowers are eligible for IDR loan forgiveness on any remaining unpaid balance. However, the canceled amount might count as taxable income on your federal tax return, so plan accordingly.</p><p>The second main forgiveness program is <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</a>. You can be eligible if you work full-time for the government or a nonprofit organization and make 120 payments under an income-driven repayment plan. Once you've fulfilled those requirements, the remaining balance on your qualifying loans is forgiven.</p><p>However, the “<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/trump-spending-bill\">One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act</a>”, which was signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes a provision to overhaul income-driven repayment plans. The ICR, PAYE, and SAVE plans will be terminated by July 1, 2028.</p><p>A new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) will be added to the shortened list of income-driven plans. RAP calculates payments using borrowers' adjusted gross income, and reduces payments by $50 per dependent. It also has a longer repayment period of 30 years before IDR forgiveness kicks in. As a whole, RAP could result in higher monthly payments and more interest charges.</p><p>“It is critical to know the borrower's current financial situation, employment, unique circumstances, and individual goals before suggesting any repayment plan, whether income-driven or aggressive,” says Carey Donaldson, founder of NewBeginnings, LLC, a company focused on student loan advocacy and financial literacy.</p><p>She notes the importance of an income-driven plan for borrowers who are seeking forgiveness, and emphasizes that “the latest federal student loan policies are not changing our suggestions to student loan borrowers; it is a pivot.”</p><h2>What repayment strategies work best for large loan amounts?</h2><p>There's no one “right” repayment solution that works for all borrowers. One or a combination of the repayment strategies below can help make paying off six figures in student loans more manageable:</p><ul><li><strong>Debt avalanche method: </strong>This method focuses on repaying the loan with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on all other student loans. After that one's paid off, you start working on the one with the next-highest rate. The goal of this strategy is to save money on interest charges.</li><li><strong>Debt snowball method:</strong> The debt snowball method involves repaying the loan with the smallest balance while making minimum payments on all other student loans. Repaying smaller loans first can help you achieve small wins to keep the payoff momentum going.</li><li><strong>Biweekly payments: </strong>Splitting your monthly payment into two smaller, biweekly payments results in 1 extra full payment per year. You'll pay off your principal faster and pay less in interest, too.</li><li><strong>Bonus lump-sum payments:</strong> Put any financial windfall, like performance bonuses and tax refunds, toward paying down your principal. This helps you repay your six-figure debt faster while saving money on interest.</li><li><strong>Put raises toward your debt:</strong> When you get a salary bump, adjust your student loan payments to reflect the increase to accelerate your debt payoff timeline.</li></ul><p>Harris also emphasizes the importance of balancing loan repayment with other goals.</p><p>“Psychologically, 'waiting to live' until the debt is gone is draining and unsustainable,” says Harris. “I help clients allocate money toward multiple priorities — retirement savings, building an emergency fund, or homeownership — while making consistent, structured loan payments. A blended approach often protects both financial health and mental health.”</p><h2>Example payoff scenarios for $150,000 in loans</h2><p>Below are sample repayment scenarios for a $150,000 student loan balance. The calculations are based on the following assumptions:</p><ul><li><strong>Tax filing status: </strong>Single, family size of 1</li><li><strong>State of residence: </strong>Colorado</li><li><strong>Salary:</strong> $100,000 per year</li><li><strong>Outstanding loan: </strong>$150,000 in Direct PLUS Loans at an 8.94% interest rate</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:265826":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"265826","content":"<p>“The biggest mistake that I see borrowers make when trying to pay off large student loan balances is believing they have no choices to pivot, that they are stuck, and most commonly that ‘they will be paying off their student loans until they die,’” says Donaldson.</p><p>The reality is that “borrowers have options. Borrowers have choices,” she adds. “There are opportunities for respite, relief, and success.

These options may cost you nothing out of pocket, but you might have to commit to an employment requirement for a certain amount of time after completing your training.</p><h2>Federal student loans for locksmithing school</h2><p>Locksmithing schools may or may not be eligible for federal student loans. That's because vocational schools need to meet two criteria to qualify for federal student aid:</p><ol><li>The school must be accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Several online and short-term locksmithing programs aren't necessarily accredited by a recognized agency.</li><li>The school must also meet Title IV requirements to be eligible for federal student aid. In particular, vocational schools must have a minimum of 10 or 15 weeks of instructional time consisting of 300 to 600 clock hours.</li></ol><p>While some locksmithing programs may meet this instructional time requirement, shorter initial training programs are more common, according to Dawne Chandler, an education coordinator for ALOA Security Professionals Association Inc. (formerly the Associated Locksmiths of America).</p><p>“Most new locksmiths begin with our five-day ALOA Fundamentals of Locksmithing (AFL) course,” says Chandler.</p><p>While this has the benefit of getting new locksmiths trained and ready for their careers quickly, it means students interested in locksmithing typically aren't eligible for federal student aid.</p><p>If you're not sure if your locksmith program is eligible for federal student aid, contact your school's financial aid office or use the Department of Education's <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/colleges\">School Search tool</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Read More: </strong></i><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/pros-and-cons\"><i>The Pros and Cons of Student Loans: Are They Right for You?</i></a></p><h2>Private loans for locksmith certification</h2><p>Even if your locksmithing program isn't eligible for federal financial aid, you may still be able to take out <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> to help you pay for this kind of vocational training.

However, you may also have to pay for tools, materials, or other necessary items on top of the tuition cost for online locksmith training.</p><p>In-person, hands-on instruction may last anywhere from a few days to several months and typically costs a couple thousand dollars or more. Most in-person training includes the cost of tools with tuition.</p><p>“At ALOA, our flagship course is the AFL-ALOA Fundamentals of Locksmithing, which costs approximately $1,500 to $2,000, depending on the session and location,” Chandler says. “The course includes tools, training materials, and five full days of immersive, in-person education.”</p><p><i><strong>You May Also Like: </strong></i><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/part-time-student-loans\"><i>11 Part-Time Student Loan Options</i></a></p><p>Other costs might include a background check and drug screening, and the cost of licensure if you live in one of the <a href=\"https://support.nastf.org/support/solutions/articles/43000562442-locksmith-license\">14 states that require locksmith licenses</a>. There may also be a fee for your licensing exam and for any practice exams you access from organizations like ALOA prior to taking your licensing exam.</p><p>One other option for locksmith training is an apprenticeship, a structured program where a paid trainee learns the trade on the job under the supervision of a professional locksmith. Typically, apprenticeship programs can last months or even years. This can be a good way to become a locksmith without having to pay for training.</p><h2>Potential earnings for locksmiths</h2><p>According to the BLS, the median annual wage for locksmiths was $48,380 as of 2023, with locksmiths in the 10th percentile earning an average of $31,620 and those in the 90th percentile earning an average of $76,460.</p><p>Locksmiths can increase their potential earnings by adding advanced certifications or specialties to their basic training. For instance, Chandler explains that “most locksmiths begin with the CRL [Certified Registered Locksmith] and pursue additional credentials gradually as they gain field experience.”</p><p>“ALOA also offers specialty certifications such as ICRL (Institutional), CMAL (Automotive), and CEL (Electronic), depending on the technician's focus,” she adds. These kinds of certifications can broaden a locksmith's skill set and boost their earnings.</p><p>One potential benefit of becoming a locksmith is that many are self-employed, which offers career flexibility and business ownership potential.</p><h2>Other ways to pay for locksmithing school</h2><p>In addition to loans, there are many other options available to fund your locksmith training. These might include:</p><ul><li><strong>Employer-sponsored training: </strong>Employers will often pay for locksmith training, according to Chandler. “We frequently see employers cover the cost of the AFL course, testing fees, or travel to our conventions as part of their workforce development, especially in institutional, government, or franchise settings,” she says. Workplaces may also offer tuition reimbursement or cover the cost of education to reach a required level of certification.</li><li><strong>Grants and scholarships:</strong> Trade organizations and schools may offer grants or scholarships to help students afford the cost of training. Chandler highlighted the ALOA Scholarship Foundation (ASF), which helps students entering the trade cover the cost of their education.</li><li><strong>GI Bill benefits: </strong>Veterans, service members, National Guard members, and qualified dependents may be able to use the GI Bill to pay for trade school, including locksmith training. However, not all locksmith programs are eligible for GI Bill benefits. For example, ALOA courses don't qualify for GI Bill funding.</li></ul><h2>Tips for borrowing responsibly</h2><p>Before you take out a loan for your locksmith program, consider the following tips. They can help protect you from taking on more debt than you can handle:</p><ul><li><strong>Exhaust your free aid options first: </strong>Covering the cost of your training with grants, scholarships, GI Bill funding, or an apprenticeship will mean you don't have to pay out of pocket for your program. Prioritize these free sources of aid before you consider taking on any loans.</li><li><strong>Don't borrow more than you need: </strong>You'll need to repay anything you borrow, plus interest, so don't take out a larger loan than you need.</li><li><strong>Compare the program cost vs. your expected income:</strong> Figure out what you believe your starting salary will be as a first-year locksmith and compare that with the cost of your program. If you're taking out a loan to pay for your program, try to set up your repayment plan based on your expected income, remembering that a shorter repayment term means a cheaper loan cost overall.</li><li><strong>Review rates:</strong> Your loan's interest rate determines how much you'll pay for the loan over its repayment term. Crunch the numbers on the interest rates offered to you so you know exactly how much you'll be paying for the loan over time.</li><li><strong>Understand your repayment options:</strong> You may have several options for when to start repayment, but each repayment option has different benefits and drawbacks. Make sure you understand what each repayment plan means for your finances and budget.</li></ul><p><i><strong>See Also: </strong></i><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/private-student-loan-forgiveness\"><i>Private Student Loan Forgiveness Alternatives</i></a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222722":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222722","content":"<p>With billions of dollars lost to consumer fraud every year, recognizing signs of personal loan scams — such as guaranteed approvals and upfront fees — is increasingly important.

The following tips can help:</p><ul><li><strong>Look for a lender's credentials, licenses, and contact information:</strong> A lender's website should make it easy for you to verify its legitimacy. Look for clear contact information, a physical address, and proof of licensure in the state where you live.</li><li><strong>Search online for reports of scams:</strong> Search online or use the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&amp;dateInterval=Month&amp;dateRange=3y&amp;date_received_max=2024-12-18&amp;date_received_min=2021-12-18&amp;lens=Product&amp;searchField=all&amp;subLens=sub_product&amp;tab=Trends\">CFPB's Consumer Complaint Database</a> for evidence of fraudulent behavior associated with a particular lender.</li><li><strong>Check third-party review sites:</strong> Sites including the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> offer reviews and ratings from previous customers. If people have had issues with lenders, you'll likely find mention of it on these sites.</li><li><strong>Consider a lender's approval process:</strong> Make sure a potential lender considers your financial information, including your credit history and income, before approving your application. Lenders that guarantee approval without reviewing this information are likely scammers.</li><li><strong>Borrow from a financial institution you already work with:</strong> Don't overlook banks or credit unions where you're already a customer. If these institutions offer competitive rates and you're satisfied with your previous experience as a customer, borrowing from them can be a simple and safe choice.

You can use the funds for almost any household expense, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">debt consolidation</a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">home improvements</a>, and most lenders don’t require you to offer an asset as collateral for the loan. You can get a personal loan from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">bank</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit union</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lender</a>, and the application process is typically quick — some lenders, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a> and LightStream, even offer funding as soon as the same day you apply.&nbsp;</p><p>Available loan amounts depend on the lender and what you can afford, but some lenders offer loans up to $100,000 or more. Repayment terms typically have a maximum of seven years.</p><h3>How home equity loans work</h3><p>A home equity loan allows you to borrow against your home’s equity, which is the share of your home you own outright. For instance, if your home is worth $500,000 and you have a mortgage balance of $200,000, you would have $300,000 in home equity.&nbsp;</p><p>Like a personal loan, a home equity loan is disbursed as a lump sum and repaid in monthly installments, typically with a fixed interest rate. Since home equity loans are secured by your home, failing to make payments can result in foreclosure. What’s more, a home equity loan often requires an appraisal and closing costs, which can add to the cost and effort of getting one.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:303590":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"303590","content":"<h2>Similarities and differences</h2><h3>Similarities of personal loans and home equity loans</h3><ul><li><strong>Funds disbursed as a lump sum:</strong> Both personal loans and home equity loans are non-revolving or closed-end loans — you receive the full balance you’re approved for in one lump sum payment.</li><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments:</strong> You repay a home equity loan or personal loan according to a predetermined schedule of monthly installments. Most personal loans and home equity loans have fixed interest rates, so the monthly payment stays the same for the life of the loan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lower APRs than credit cards:</strong>&nbsp;Taking out a personal loan or home equity loan is typically cheaper than carrying a balance on one or more credit cards. The average APR (annual percentage rate) for credit cards is over 21%, according to the Federal Reserve, while the average APR for a 2-year personal loan is just over 11%. The average rate for a $30,000 home equity loan is around 8%, according to Bankrate. (<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/what-is-apr\">APR</a> indicates the annual borrowing cost, including interest and upfront fees, as a percentage of the loan amount.)</li><li><strong>Upfront fees:</strong>&nbsp;Home equity loans typically have closing costs ranging from 2% to 5% of the loan amount. Many personal loans also come with an upfront fee known as an origination fee. This fee could be up to 15% of the loan amount if you have fair or bad credit, but it’s often much lower if you have good credit. Some personal loan lenders don’t charge any fees, and some banks offer home equity loans with no closing costs.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Differences between personal loans and home equity loans</h3><ul><li><strong>Funding timeline:</strong>&nbsp;Personal loans offer quick funding, sometimes as soon as the same day you apply. Home equity loans typically take longer to fund. While some lenders, like Rocket Mortgage, offer an automated valuation model (AVM) to speed up the process, many still require a traditional appraisal. It can take up to two months to get the funds, depending on the lender and your application.</li><li><strong>Use of funds:</strong> Restricted uses vary by lender, but home equity loans are generally more flexible than personal loans. Most personal loan lenders prohibit you from using the loan funds to buy a home or pay for college, while home equity lenders typically allow you to use the funds for these purposes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> Personal loan repayment terms typically range from 2 to 7 years. Some lenders offer longer terms — for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a> offers terms up to 20 years for home improvement loans. Home equity loan repayment terms typically range from 5 to 30 years, so they’re better for borrowers who need longer to repay.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Collateral requirement:</strong> Home equity loans are secured by your home. Many lenders require you to have at least 20% equity in your home to qualify. And if you miss payments, the lender could seize your home. Personal loans are usually unsecured, so there’s no risk of losing an asset. That said, some lenders, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-egg-personal-loans-review\">Best Egg</a>, offer the option of a secured personal loan at a lower rate.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Impact on credit</h2><h3>How personal loans affect your credit score</h3><p>A personal loan affects your credit score in several ways, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial application:</strong> When you formally apply for a personal loan, the lender typically performs a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-finance/how-long-does-a-hard-inquiry-stay-on-your-credit\">hard credit inquiry</a>, which usually causes your credit score to decline a few points. You can often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify</a>, however, to get a rate estimate without impacting your credit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Additional debt:</strong> A personal loan adds to your outstanding debt, which accounts for 30% of your FICO score. The more you owe relative to the principal loan amount or your available credit, the greater the impact — so your score is most affected during the initial months of repayment. If you use a personal loan to consolidate credit card debt, however, the reduction in your credit utilization may increase your score.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Credit mix:</strong>&nbsp;If you’ve only had credit cards in the past and this personal loan is your first installment loan, it will add to your credit mix. That could positively impact your score, though to a lesser extent than other factors.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Payment behavior:</strong>&nbsp;Your payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score (accounting for 35%). On-time payments help your score, while missed or late payments damage your credit.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>How home equity loans affect your credit score</h3><p>Because a home equity loan is another type of installment loan, the impact on your credit score is similar to a personal loan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it can be easier on your credit to submit multiple home equity loan applications — newer FICO Score models treat all home equity loan applications within 45 days as one inquiry for the purpose of scoring.&nbsp;</p><p>“If your application is approved, it will show up as an installment loan on your credit report,” says Kristina Morales, Chief Finance Contributor at Loanfully. “This can be positive or negative depending on your current credit health,” she says. It may improve your credit mix, but it also increases your amounts owed. And your payment behavior can have either a positive or negative impact, just like a personal loan.</p><h2>Scenarios when a personal loan makes more sense</h2><ul><li><strong>You plan to move soon:</strong>&nbsp;If you plan to sell your house, you’ll need to pay off your first mortgage and the home equity loan to transfer the title. Paying upfront fees on a home equity loan doesn’t make sense if you plan to move within a few years — especially if your home loses value. In this case, you could owe more than what your home is worth and need to pay the difference to close.</li><li><strong>You need to borrow less than $10,000:</strong>&nbsp;Most lenders require you to borrow at least $10,000 for a home equity loan. If you need a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/1000-loan\">small loan</a> to cover an unexpected expense, like a minor home repair or veterinary bill, a personal loan typically works better. That’s especially true if you can pay off the loan within a few years — home equity loans become most advantageous when you need a large loan with a long repayment term.</li><li><strong>You need the money fast:</strong> If you need an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency loan</a>, a personal loan fits the bill. Some lenders offer same-day or next-day funding, so a personal loan is great for urgent funding needs, like paying your auto mechanic so you can get your car back. The timeline for a home equity loan can be unpredictable, and you could wait weeks to months for the funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:303594":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"303594","content":"<h2>Scenarios when a home equity loan makes more sense</h2><ul><li><strong>You’re investing in real estate:</strong> Most personal loan lenders won’t allow you to use the funds to invest, but you can typically use a home equity loan to make a down payment on a rental property. If you find a great opportunity, the rental income may cover your loan payments. In fact, some mortgage lenders allow you to use projected rental income to qualify for a home loan if your salary is insufficient to meet requirements. Just be aware of the risks — if the investment doesn’t pan out and you can’t afford the payments, you could lose your primary residence.</li><li><strong>You’re facing a large expense:</strong> Home equity loans are typically worth the wait and the upfront fees if you have substantial equity in your home and you need to borrow a lot of cash. Whether you’re consolidating credit card debt, remodeling your home, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/ivf-loans\">financing IVF</a>, a home equity loan gives you more wiggle room to pay for a large expense over time, usually at a lower interest rate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You’re hoping to claim a tax deduction:</strong>&nbsp;Interest on a home equity loan may be tax-deductible, depending on the tax year and how you use the funds. Through 2025, the interest on home equity loan funds used for certain purposes, like improving your home or buying/building a second residence, may be tax-deductible up to a limit.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:303598":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"303598","content":"<h2>Alternative funding options to consider</h2><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>Like a home equity loan, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/heloc?source=global-nav\">HELOC</a> is secured by the equity you’ve built in your home. But rather than providing a lump sum all at once, a HELOC allows you to borrow repeatedly up to your credit limit without reapplying.&nbsp;</p><p>“If the borrower doesn’t know how much they will need, a HELOC is a better option because they will only borrow when funds are needed and pay interest only on the balance that is outstanding,” says Morales. Your credit line replenishes as you make payments.&nbsp;</p><p>HELOCs typically have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/heloc-closing-costs\">lower closing costs</a> than home equity loans, and some lenders offer a quick close on a HELOC, allowing you to use the credit line within a few days.&nbsp;</p><h3>Personal line of credit (PLOC)</h3><p>A PLOC is similar to a HELOC except that it is typically unsecured. Banks and credit unions offer PLOCs to their account holders, allowing them to borrow against the credit line on an ongoing basis without collateral. PLOCs sometimes come with fees that make borrowing costly, so be sure to evaluate any fees before applying.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cash-out refinance</h3><p>A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage loan with a new and larger home loan, allowing you to keep the difference as cash. A cash-out refinance is most advantageous when you can achieve a lower interest rate on the new mortgage. But Morales says it’s sometimes worth refinancing at a higher rate if the cash allows the borrower to pay off high-interest credit card debt. “While their mortgage interest rate may go up 4% to 5%, after paying off high-interest credit card debt with the cash out refi funds, they may actually be saving each month,” she says.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/credit-card\">Credit cards</a> are a great option for small purchases you can repay quickly, as most offer a grace period during which interest doesn’t accrue. Some credit card issuers also offer 0% APR promotions to new cardholders, allowing you to avoid interest for up to two years. But credit cards typically have high APRs outside of zero-interest promotional periods. So if you think you’ll need to carry a balance past the promotional period, a personal loan could save you money.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:308094":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"308094","content":"<p>In the 2025-26 academic year, the average published price for tuition and fees for full-time undergraduate students was $11,950 at public, in-state four-year schools, and $45,000 at private four-year schools, according to the College Board.

Your rate is fixed for five years, and then, depending on market rates, it moves higher or lower every year after that.</p><p>There are usually caps on how high the interest rate can adjust. Each time your rate adjusts, your payment will also adjust to ensure you pay off your mortgage on time.</p><h3>Important mortgage terms to know when shopping</h3><p>Your adjustable interest rate is based on a specific index and margin. Each year, your lender will look at the index specified in your paperwork and add the required margin — this will be your new rate for the coming year.</p><p>Here’s a quick breakdown of what the index and margin are and how they work:</p><ul><li><strong>Index:</strong> The benchmark interest rate based on current market conditions. In the past, many mortgages used the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), but that was phased out in favor of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as of June 30, 2023. Other indexes that might be considered include the Cost of Funds Index (COFI) and Constant Maturity Treasuries (CMT).</li><li><strong>Margin:</strong> This is the fixed amount that’s added to the index by your lender, giving you your interest rate for the year. For example, if you have a margin of 3% and your rate adjusts based on the SOFR — and the SOFR is at 0.15% — your new mortgage rate would be 3.15%.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:221302":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"221302","content":"<h3>Interest rate caps</h3><p>The good news is that your mortgage interest adjustment is limited. So, you won’t see your rate shoot up out of nowhere.</p><p>In many cases, a lender will issue a cap based on the first adjustment, subsequent adjustments, and a lifetime cap. A common cap is the 2/2/5 cap. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/interest-rate-cap\">how this cap structure works</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial adjustment cap:</strong> The first number represents the initial adjustment cap. This is the first time the lender has changed the rate after the fixed rate ends. So, in this case, the rate can’t be more than two percentage points higher than your initial rate, no matter how much <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/rates\">interest rates</a> have increased.</li><li><strong>Subsequent adjustment cap:</strong> The second number reflects the cap on the following adjustments. Once again, in this case, the adjustment can’t go higher than two percentage points.</li><li><strong>Lifetime cap:</strong> The final number shows the lifetime cap. As long as you have the loan, the interest rate can’t go five percentage points beyond your initial rate if you have a 2/2/5 cap.</li></ul><h3>Loan terms</h3><p>5/1 ARMs typically come with an overall term of 15 years or 30 years. The interest rate remains fixed for the first five years and then adjusts every year after that for the remainder of the loan.</p><p>Let’s run through a quick example to better understand what you’d pay each month (in principal and interest only) with a 5/1 ARM vs. a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:221306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"221306","content":"<h2>Pros and cons of a 5/1 ARM</h2><p>The low initial interest rate of an adjustable-rate mortgage makes it an enticing option, and it could make homebuying more affordable.</p><p>But you’ll have to be comfortable with the uncertainty.

Since the rate can fluctuate, you might have a higher interest rate and a minimum monthly payment. It can also be harder to plan your budget when your payment might be adjusted at intervals. Because of this uncertainty, it should be no surprise that fixed-rate loans are more common. According to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, just <a href=\"https://www.fhfa.gov/data/dashboard/nmdb-outstanding-residential-mortgage-statistics\">3.9% of mortgages had adjustable rates</a> in the last quarter of 2024, down from 4% the previous year.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, if you can secure a lower interest rate and you expect to sell, refinance, or pay off your mortgage in the near future, an ARM may be an option.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:228934":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"228934","content":"<p>A $400,000 mortgage comes with a variety of costs in addition to your monthly payment.

All the FFEL loans currently within Navient's portfolio will transition to MOHELA for loan servicing over the course of the next 18 to 24 months.</p><p>It's also important to note that you have the option of consolidating FFEL loans into a federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loan-consolidation/direct-consolidation-loan\">Direct Consolidation Loan</a>. This can result in your loan being transferred to a different federal loan servicer. If you don't want to lose the progress you’ve made toward <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/get-student-loan-forgiveness\">loan forgiveness</a>, you'll need to consolidate your FFEL loans by Apr. 30, 2024, to ensure you get credit for payments you’ve already made.</p><h3>If you have private student loans managed by Navient</h3><p>While Navient's private student loan portfolio is less substantial than its FFEL portfolio, the servicer still has $17 billion of <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> under its control. Like the FFEL loans, private student loans will become the responsibility of MOHELA to service after the transition is completed throughout the latter half of 2024 and the upcoming two years.</p><h3>If you have federal loans managed by Navient</h3><p>Navient stopped servicing other federal student loans besides FFEL loans as of Dec. 31, 2021. So if you had other federal loans serviced by Navient in the past, you should not be impacted by this new transition.

As the name suggests, payday loans are intended to help borrowers cover their expenses until their next payday. However, many people end up renewing or rolling over their loans, leading to fees which can trap them in a cycle of debt.</p><p>Due to their high costs and short repayment schedules, payday loans generally aren’t recommended. Payday loan alternatives include personal loans, credit counseling, and borrowing money from friends and family. Here’s what to know about payday loans and other available options.</p><h2>How do payday loans work?&nbsp;</h2><p>Payday loans are low-amount, high-fee loans that are available in some states. Payday loans are meant to be repaid quickly, usually within two to four weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>But many borrowers struggle to repay payday loans on time, incurring extra fees. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/Payday_Loans_Highlights_From_CFPB_Research.pdf\">study</a> from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that four out of five payday loans are rolled over or reborrowed.</p><p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-do-payday-loans-work\">How Do Payday Loans Work?</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:227046":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"227046","content":"<p>Most payday loan lenders <a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\">don’t run a credit check</a>, which can make approval easy, especially if you have bad credit. They usually want to see that you’re employed or have a source of income, and you’ll need a bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>If <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">approved for a payday loan</a>, you’ll provide a means for the lender to collect payment when it’s due, such as postdating a check for the amount borrowed plus fees. The lender would then deposit that on the due date if you don’t repay the loan sooner.</p><p>If your loan is due and you can’t afford to pay, contact the lender to ask about your options. All states but Michigan require payday loan lenders to offer no-cost extended repayment plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that this is different from rolling over the loan amount, which will involve additional fees. If you don’t live in Michigan and need more time to pay, choose a no-cost extended repayment plan instead of a rollover.</p><h2>How to get a payday loan&nbsp;</h2><p>The application process for a payday loan is relatively straightforward. Typically, you only need a photo ID, a bank account, and proof of income (such as a pay stub or bank statement). You also have to be 18 or older to get a payday loan.</p><p>If approved for a payday loan, you may receive funds immediately in cash, check, via a prepaid debit card, or as a direct bank deposit. It’s essential to carefully review the <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">loan terms</a>, including the repayment schedule, interest rate, fees, and any penalties or consequences for late payments.</p><p>Depending on your repayment agreement, the lender may collect funds on the due date through one of the following methods:</p><ul><li>Cash a postdated check you provided when the loan was issued</li><li>Withdraw funds automatically from your bank account</li><li>Accept payment in-store or online</li></ul><h2>How much do payday loans cost?&nbsp;</h2><p>Payday loans are significantly more expensive than traditional loans or credit cards. Payday lenders generally charge a percentage or dollar amount for each $100 you borrow. Fees of $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed are common.</p><p>For example, a two-week payday loan with a $15 fee for every $100 you borrow translates to an APR of almost 400%, according to the CFPB. For context, the average interest rate on a credit card was 21.16%, and the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan was 11.57%, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/\"><u>Federal Reserve</u></a>.</p><p>Let’s look at what a payday loan might cost in real life.</p><p><strong>Payday loan:</strong> $500</p><p><strong>Fees:</strong> $50 ($10 per $100 borrowed)</p><p><strong>Total owed:</strong> $550</p><p><strong>APR (over 2 weeks):&nbsp;</strong>261%</p><p>If the due date is two weeks later, that means you need to come up with $550 (or more, depending on fees) in two weeks. If you can’t repay the full amount, the lender may offer a rollover or renewal, which may result in additional fees and keep you in debt longer.</p><h2>Alternatives to payday loans&nbsp;</h2><p>Before getting a payday loan, it’s important to consider more affordable alternatives.</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> are preferable to payday loans as they have lower costs and <a href=\"/personal-loan/long-term-personal-loans\">longer repayment periods</a>.

To preserve your relationship, make sure you can fulfill the payment terms you agree to.</p><h3>Contact your creditors</h3><p>Ask your creditors about repayment options before getting a payday loan.

As the name suggests, payday loans are intended to help borrowers cover their expenses until their next payday. However, many people end up renewing or rolling over their loans, leading to fees which can trap them in a cycle of debt.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Due to their high costs and short repayment schedules, payday loans generally aren’t recommended. Payday loan alternatives include personal loans, credit counseling, and borrowing money from friends and family.

All states but Michigan require payday loan lenders to offer no-cost extended repayment plans. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Keep in mind that this is different from rolling over the loan amount, which will involve additional fees.

You also have to be 18 or older to get a payday loan.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If approved for a payday loan, you may receive funds immediately in cash, check, via a prepaid debit card, or as a direct bank deposit.

Payday lenders generally charge a percentage or dollar amount for each $100 you borrow. Fees of $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed are common.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For example, a two-week payday loan with a $15 fee for every $100 you borrow translates to an APR of almost 400%, according to the CFPB. For context, the average interest rate on a credit card was 21.16%, and the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan was 11.57%, according to the <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0"><a class=" styles_none__4uqec styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Federal Reserve</a></a>.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Let’s look at what a payday loan might cost in real life.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payday loan:</strong> $500</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Fees:</strong> $50 ($10 per $100 borrowed)</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Total owed:</strong> $550</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">APR (over 2 weeks): </strong>261%</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If the due date is two weeks later, that means you need to come up with $550 (or more, depending on fees) in two weeks.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

It offers personal loans for a variety of uses, including debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, and home improvement, with funding as soon as the next business day. You can also manage your account using LendingPoint's mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With low starting APRs and a mid-600s credit score minimum, LendingPoint is best suited for borrowers with fair credit or a limited credit history looking for smaller loans. Some borrowers with good credit may also benefit from a LendingPoint loan.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved. Plus, the company has a 4.7 Trustpilot rating and a 4.16 customer rating on BBB (the Better Business Bureau) — indicating satisfied customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Reprise is not for everyone.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence). Note that even if you prequalify for a personal loan with OneMain, getting approved isn't a given.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

A negative SAI means you have a greater need for aid, but there's no specific number that designates the threshold between high and low. And a high SAI at one school may not be considered so at another university.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara Schmitt, director of financial aid at King's College, notes that “the SAI, just like the EFC, is the one number that comes out when you do your FAFSA,” adding, \"it doesn't matter if you go to a local community college or Ivy League school, that SAI stays the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo show why this matters, Schmitt used an example of a student with a 15,000 SAI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If they go to their local community college, which has a lower tuition, they may only be eligible for student loans.

But she highlights the fact that if they go to a higher-priced school, “that would be considered a low SAI because it depends upon the cost of attendance.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, you may find that an SAI that bars you from receiving aid at one school meets the eligibility requirements for grants or institutionally backed aid at another school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe SAI and federal student loan eligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt's important to keep in mind that there's more to a school's aid package than SAI-driven grants and scholarships.

Schmitt offers another example:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Let's say the tuition at a specific school is $60,000, and a student has a 30,000 SAI and is eligible for a $27,000 scholarship,” she says. “The $27,000 is deducted from the 30,000 SAI, leaving a need of $3,000. If the student received another scholarship for $1,000, the total need would be reduced to $2,000.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The maximum federal loan amount (subsidized or not) a dependent freshman can get is $5,500 combined,” she notes. “The most out of that $5,500 that can be subsidized is $3,500. In this scenario, the student is only eligible for $2,000 of a subsidized loan and not the full $3,500,” says Schmitt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow is the Student Aid Index calculated?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe SAI is based on information from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\"\u003eFAFSA\u003c/a\u003e, which includes information about both the student and their parents, also referred to as “contributors.” Primarily, this information includes:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStudent and contributor tax returns\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStudent and contributor Social Security numbers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCash and account balances, including checking and savings accounts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNet worth of any investments and bank statements\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny untaxed income\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHousehold size\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that in the case of divorce, financial information about a parent's spouse may also be included in the calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther, Schmitt notes that in some cases, the new SAI calculation also changes who's defined as the contributing parent. This is particularly true for parents who are divorced or not married and living in separate houses, where one parent contributes more financial support, such as through child support, than the other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It's not the custodial parent like it used to be.

One guideline you can follow is the 28% rule, which suggests you spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. Let’s use the earlier example that assumes a 30-year loan term and 6% APR, which results in a monthly payment of $1,498.88. Divide the monthly payment by 28% to find the ideal gross monthly income (1,498.88/0.28 = 5,353.14).

The only exception is if half your vested balance is less than $10,000. Then you can borrow up to $10,000.
