You can borrow up to your school-certified cost of attendance and apply just once annually to get the funds you need for the entire academic year. Plus, applying for a Smart Option Student Loan with a cosigner may help you get a better rate. Through Sallie Mae, you can find a variety of loans designed for specific needs, including loans for MBA programs, law school, medical school, and health profession programs.","review":{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4.4,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Renee Fleck"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json" data-next-head="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"College Ave","description":"College Ave offers student loans for almost every type of degree program, with a range of repayment options, including a unique 8-year repayment term. Additionally, you can get extended grace periods of as long as 36 months on graduate, dental, and medical student loans. About 90% of undergraduates applying with a cosigner are approved for additional student loans. However, you must complete at least half of your repayment term before you can remove a cosigner for your loan.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible. Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments. However, cosigners on loans for international students do not qualify.","review":{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4.9,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Renee Fleck"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json" data-next-head="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"Abe","description":"Abe's private student loans are available to undergraduates, graduate students, and students in certificate programs.

Borrowers can also extend their grace period up to an additional six months. Plus, you can lengthen your repayment term by five years, which can be helpful if you need to lower your monthly payments or request a hardship forbearance for 12 months.","review":{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4.3,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Renee Fleck"}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json" data-next-head="">

If needed, consider student loans after exploring these options.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Sallie Mae give loans for cosmetology school?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Sallie Mae offers loans for students attending certain cosmetology programs.

These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants:</strong> If you're planning to go into education, you may be eligible to receive up to $4,000 each year with a TEACH Grant. To receive the grant, you must meet eligibility criteria and agree to teach full-time for at least 4 years in a high-need field at an eligible school or educational service agency. You have 8 years to complete your service obligation after you graduate or are no longer enrolled at the institution where you got your grant.

If that's the case, consider looking into the following alternatives:</p><h3>Fellowships and assistantships</h3><p>Graduate fellowships and assistantships both provide financial support to graduate students, but they have some key differences.</p><p>A <strong>fellowship</strong> offers a living stipend to graduate students who demonstrate academic excellence, but it's not a form of employment. Instead, graduate schools often use fellowships to incentivize students to complete their program there. You can think of a fellowship as a merit-based award. Fellowships can come from a university, private foundation, or local, state, or federal agency.</p><p><strong>Assistantships</strong>, on the other hand, allow grad students to earn money in exchange for teaching or conducting research. An assistantship can offer a monthly salary and tuition waiver, and may cover institutional fees and health insurance.</p><h3>Employer tuition assistance</h3><p>Many employers offer tuition assistance (paying for courses up front) or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">reimbursement</a> (paying you back for your course costs) to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. If you're working full- or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/part-time-student-loans\">part-time</a> to put yourself through grad school, reach out to your employer to find out if it offers educational assistance. Companies can offer up to $5,250 per employee each year tax-free.</p><h3>Private student loans</h3><p>In situations where federal <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/graduate-student-loans\">student loans for grad students</a> and other forms of financial aid fall short, it may be worth considering private student loans as a way to bridge the gap.

IDR plans set payments at a percentage of income.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you’ve signed up, you can qualify for forgiveness either by participating in Public Service Loan Forgiveness or by making a certain number of payments on your IDR plan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, big changes are coming to IDR plans in 2026. Specifically:</p><ul><li>If you’re a new borrower after July 1, 2026, you’ll only have one income-driven repayment plan option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). You’ll have to choose between RAP and the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have existing student loans and don’t take out any new loans after July 1, 2026, you’ll continue to have access to a selection of IDR plans, including Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). The IBR Plan will no longer require financial hardship.&nbsp;</li><li>PAYE and ICR are being fully phased out after July 1, 2028. If you were an existing borrower before July 1, 2026, you can switch to IBR prior to the July 2028 deadline to remain on this plan. Otherwise, you’ll be switched to RAP.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Because the IDR plans are changing, your monthly payments and your timeline for eligibility for loan forgiveness may change.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324806":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324806","content":"<h2>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h2><p>Participating in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> program is one of the fastest ways to get your student debt discharged.

Because the available IDR plans are changing soon, you may need to switch to a different repayment plan as you work toward making your 120 qualifying on-time payments.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education also imposed new restrictions on qualifying employment, making clear that you cannot qualify for PSLF if you are working for “organizations that engage in unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose, including supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration.”</p><p>Some critics have argued that the restriction could be applied in a politically influenced manner and unfairly block some organizations from qualifying for forgiveness.</p><h2>Income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness</h2><p>IDR plans are another popular way to qualify for loan forgiveness. These options allow borrowers to set payments at a specific percentage of income, and then any balance that remains at the end of the required repayment period is forgiven.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are three active IDR plans and one plan that has been suspended by the courts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\"><strong>Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;If you first borrowed after July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years. If you first borrowed before July 1, 2014, payments are capped at 15% of discretionary income, and remaining balances are forgiven after 25 years.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pay as You Earn (PAYE):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, and forgiveness is available after 20 years. Payments must be less than the amount due under the Standard Repayment Plan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR):</strong>&nbsp;Payments are set at the lesser of 20% of income or the amount you'd pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over the course of 12 years, adjusted based on income. Forgiveness is available after 25 years.&nbsp; This plan is currently the only option parents with PLUS loans can qualify for, but they must consolidate first.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE):</strong>&nbsp;The courts have blocked the SAVE Plan, so borrowers can’t enroll in this plan.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Anyone who borrowed before July 1, 2026, can choose between IBR, PAYE, and ICR, provided they don't take out any new loans. However, PAYE and ICR are going away after July 1, 2028, and borrowers on one of these plans will need to change to IBR before that date or will be put on the new Repayment Assistance Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>The partial financial hardship requirement for the IBR Plan is being eliminated, and parents with loans issued before July 1, 2028, can consolidate to become eligible for IBR as long as the consolidation is completed before the deadline and they enroll in ICR (including making one payment) immediately before enrolling in IBR.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Repayment Assistance Plan is the only IDR plan that will be available to new borrowers after July 1, 2026. Borrowers with older loans can also choose to switch to RAP.</p><p>RAP calculates payments based on adjusted gross income (AGI) instead of discretionary income. Payments on the RAP plan are between 1% and 10% of AGI, but there’s an annual minimum payment of $120. When payments don't fully cover monthly interest, unpaid interest is canceled so your balance doesn't increase. Any remaining balance after 30 years is forgiven.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:16110":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"16110","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:324810":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"324810","content":"<h2>Profession-based forgiveness programs</h2><p>There are also loan forgiveness programs available for people in certain professions.

Many organizations offer scholarships specifically for beauty students, such as the Great Clips Great Scholarship Program and the Keller Cosmetology Scholarship. Some schools even offer scholarship opportunities of their own.</p><p>“The main benefit of receiving a scholarship is that you do not have to pay that money back. [Make sure] to check with your institution to identify what scholarships they might offer, and be sure to check out <a href=\"https://beautychangeslives.org/\">www.beautychangeslives.org</a>,” says Worthen.</p><h3>Work part-time to lower costs</h3><p>Balancing school with a part-time job can help reduce your reliance on student loans. If you can, look for work in the beauty industry — gaining experience while you're in school can lead to job opportunities after graduation. Some employers even offer tuition assistance programs, which can help cover the cost of your education while you work.</p><h3>Start making loan payments while in school</h3><p>Student loans often come with the option to delay repayment until after graduation, but interest continues to add up while you're in school. If possible, try to make small payments while you're in school to help keep your loan balance from growing. Many lenders allow interest-only payments while you're enrolled, which can prevent interest from <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest\">capitalizing</a> and reduce what you owe in the long term. Turning on autopay, if your lender offers it, can also lower your interest rate by about 0.25 percentage points.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15734":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15734","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:317666":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"317666","content":"<h2>Why you can trust our Credible experts</h2><p>The Credible editorial team is independent and unbiased.

When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments.

For example, its Outcomes-Based Loan, which doesn't require established credit or a cosigner, is available to juniors and seniors. When assessing your application, Ascent considers factors including your school, major, and GPA to determine if you're eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ascent also offers its Progressive Repayment plan to qualified borrowers. It allows you to begin with smaller payments at the start of the repayment term and then gradually pay more each month over time. If you borrow with a cosigner, they can be released after you make as few as 12 monthly payments. However, cosigners on loans for international students do not qualify.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Doesn’t charge application fees or origination fees</li><li>Offers discounts of 0.50 to 1 percentage points when making automatic payments</li><li>Can get a 1% cash-back reward after you graduate</li><li>Grace periods from 9 to 36 months</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>May find lower interest rates with some competitors</li><li>International students don’t have option to release cosigners</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Interest rates</p><div><p>Fixed or variable</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum credit score</p><div><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum income</p><div><p>$30,000 for most loans</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan terms</p><div><p>5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or 20 years</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amounts</p><div><p>$2,001 minimum up to your school’s annual cost of attendance; lifetime limits of $200,000 for undergrads and $400,000 for graduates</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Cosigner release</p><div><p>12 months</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Eligibility</p><div><p>Must be a U.S. citizen or DACA student enrolled at least half time at an eligible institution.

If you can, look for work in the beauty industry — gaining experience while you&#x27;re in school can lead to job opportunities after graduation. Some employers even offer tuition assistance programs, which can help cover the cost of your education while you work.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Start making loan payments while in school</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Student loans often come with the option to delay repayment until after graduation, but interest continues to add up while you&#x27;re in school. If possible, try to make small payments while you&#x27;re in school to help keep your loan balance from growing. Many lenders allow interest-only payments while you&#x27;re enrolled, which can prevent interest from <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="../refinance-student-loans/capitalized-interest.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">capitalizing</a> and reduce what you owe in the long term.
