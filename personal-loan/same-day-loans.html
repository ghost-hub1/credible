There are no origination fees or other fees, and loans can be used for a wide range of purposes Funds can be available as soon as the same day you apply, and you could have up to 20 years to repay certain types of loans, including home improvement loans, RV loans, and boat loans.  Unlike most lenders, LightStream does not let you prequalify on its site — but you can prequalify through Credible.

Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.  To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate.

    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Are same-day loans and payday loans the same?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Whether a same-day loan is better than using a credit card depends on your specific needs and goals. Credit card cash advances provide quick access to funds but often have high fees and interest rates. Same-day personal loans might offer lower rates and longer repayment terms, which could be better for larger borrowing needs. BNPL can be a good option for specific purchases if you can afford an upfront down payment and repay within the interest-free period.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compare the APR, fees, and repayment expectations with each option to see which works best for you.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where can I get a same-day loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You can get same-day loans from online lenders like <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/rocket-loans-personal-loans-review\">Rocket Loans</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a>. Payday loans are available from storefront lenders and online (though these loans are not advised). Cash advance apps are available through Dave, EarnIn, MoneyLion, and many others. Credit unions may offer same-day payday alternative loans (PALs). BNPL apps can be found by visiting the sites of providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Sezzle, or via many retailer websites.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are same-day loans better than using a credit card?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Same-day loans and credit cards are both tools that you can use to cover immediate expenses. Credit cards are a type of revolving debt where you pay as you go, while a same-day loan has a closed term with a beginning and an end.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credit cards are generally better for small, everyday expenses. Using a personal loan for a large, one-time purchase could give you more time to repay the money you've borrowed, and the APR might be lower.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you get a same-day loan without a credit check?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes, some same-day loans, such as payday and pawnshop loans, don’t require a credit check. Cash advance apps often don't perform traditional credit checks, but will access and assess your banking information. However, loans that don’t check your credit often have much higher rates than loans that do. Most personal loan lenders will check your credit as part of the application process, but you might still get a personal loan even with bad credit. Plus, the rate would likely be much lower than no-credit-check alternatives.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you get a same-day loan for bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>Yes, you may be able to get a same-day loan with bad credit, but your options will be limited and the terms less favorable. Some lenders offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">personal loans to borrowers with bad credit</a>&nbsp;— start by&nbsp;prequalifying with bad-credit lenders. Though these loans typically have higher APRs than other personal loans, they’ll be much lower than payday loans and most cash apps. Plus, you can typically borrow a larger amount.&nbsp; If you apply with a cosigner, get a joint personal loan, or get a secured loan, you might have a better chance of qualifying.</p>"}}]}

Apply for scholarships and grants</h3><p>Unlike student loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">college scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a> don't have to be repaid - which makes them a great way to pay for school. There's no limit to how many scholarships and grants you can get, so it's a good idea to apply for as many as you can.</p><p>Many scholarships and grants are specifically designed for veterinary students, such as the:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.akc.org/press-releases/american-kennel-club-announces-recipients-2021-veterinary-scholarships/\">American Kennel Club (AKC) Veterinary Outreach Scholarships</a>: For vet students who have participated in AKC events and programs; depending on the sponsor, students might be awarded up to $10,000</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/merck-animal-health-scholarship/\">Merck Animal Health Veterinary Student Scholarship Program</a>: Awards $5,000 scholarships to second- and third-year vet students with financial need</li><li><a href=\"https://www.avmf.org/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/national-regional-scholarships/\">The American Veterinary Medical Foundation scholarships</a>: Offers a list of available scholarships and requirements for vet students</li></ul><h3>2. Fill out the FAFSA</h3><p>Fill out the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> before the deadline. For the 2025-26 academic year, you have until June 30, 2026. Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine what federal student loans and other financial aid you qualify for. Keep in mind that some aid is given on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's a good idea to submit the FAFSA as early as possible.</p><p>You might also qualify for school-based scholarships depending on your FAFSA results.</p><h3>3. Get a job or qualify for a work-study program</h3><p>Working during school could help you cover some of your school expenses. If you have financial need, you might qualify for the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study program</a>, which provides part-time <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">jobs for college students</a>.</p><p>These jobs are often on campus, though in some cases, you might work for a private nonprofit or for-profit employer that has partnered with your school.</p><h3>4. Apply for federal student loans</h3><p>If you need to borrow for school, it's usually best to rely on federal student loans first. This is because these loans come with federal benefits and protections, such as access to income-driven repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs.</p><p>There are two main types of federal student loans that vet school students might qualify for:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized loans:</strong> These loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students regardless of financial need. Unlike undergraduate subsidized loans, you're responsible for all of the interest that accrues on unsubsidized loans.</li><li><strong>Grad PLUS loans:</strong> These loans are available to students who want to pay for grad school or a professional program. Keep in mind, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">grad PLUS loans</a> usually come with higher interest rates than other federal loans. They also require a credit check.</li></ul><p>After you submit the FAFSA, your school will send you a financial aid award letter detailing what federal student loans and other financial aid you're eligible for. You can then decide which aid you'd like to accept.</p><h3>5. Apply for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program</h3><p>Check into the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) after graduation. It's a federal program designed to help with a national shortage of veterinarians in rural and agricultural areas. Specialized vets focus on food animals, like cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry.</p><p>The VMLRP offers up to $40,000 per year toward eligible government and commercial student loan repayment to eligible veterinarians in return for their service in high-priority veterinary shortages for three years. These are the requirements:</p><ul><li>Have at least $15,000 in qualified veterinary educational loan debt</li><li>Hold a DVM (or equivalent) from an accredited school</li><li>Start within 90 days of award notification in a designated veterinary shortage situation</li><li>Meet all <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.9\">other requirements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XXXIV/part-3431/subpart-B/section-3431.10\">regulations</a></li></ul><h3>6. Private loans for vet school</h3><p>After you've exhausted your scholarship, grant, and federal student loan options, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> could help fill any financial gaps left over. While these loans don't come with federal protections, they do offer some benefits of their own - for example, you can apply at any time, and you might be able to borrow more than you'd get with a federal loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable:898":{"__typename":"strapiComponentBlocksLenderTable","id":"898","refiLenders":[],"isLenders":[{"__typename":"strapiBlogLenderType","name":"Abe","slug":"abe","variableRate":true,"fixedRate":true,"minCreditScore":"660","loanTerms":"5, 7, 10, 15, 20","loanAmount":"$1,000 up to school-certified cost of attendance (aggregate $225,000 limit)","discounts":"Autopay, Good Payment Behavior","cosignerRelease":"12 months","repaymentOptions":"Full deferral, immediate, fixed/flat, and interest only","fees":"None","degrees":"Undergraduate, graduate, certificate, advanced degrees","vertical":"inschool","lenderLogo":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/05cbce1b-b2d8-4403-9a7b-233da5a6d1b2","alternativeText":null},"credibleBlogContent":{"__typename":"strapiLenderContentType","rating":4.3,"reviewLink":"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/abe-student-loans-review","bestFor":"Best for Payment Relief Options","expertInsights":"<p>Few private lenders match the borrower protections Abe offers.

It can be used for paying off credit card debt, or any debts that carry interest.</p><p>To use this method, look at your revolving credit (such as credit cards) and installment consumer loans (personal loans, student loans, or auto loans). Determine which has the highest interest rate, and pay that one off first. Once it’s paid off, you can focus on the next highest interest rate. You’ll save money because you’re paying off the loan that is costing you the most money over time.</p><p>The debt avalanche method is one of many <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-management-plan\">debt management</a> techniques that personal finance experts recommend. The debt snowball method involves paying off the smallest balance first and then going after the next smallest. Other methods take into account saving for retirement. The debt avalanche method, on the other hand, focuses solely on interest to save you money.</p><h2>How does the debt avalanche method work?</h2><p>The debt avalanche method is a three-step process that you repeat until your debt is paid off. Here’s how it works.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Identifying high-interest debts</h3><p>Look at all your debts and determine which one has the highest interest. This could include:</p><ul><li>Credit cards</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-is-a-personal-loan\">Personal loans</a></li><li><a href=\"/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-200k\">Student loans</a></li><li>Auto loans</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222282","content":"<h3>2. Prioritizing payments</h3><p>Come up with a game plan that prioritizes the debt with the highest interest rate. Then, rank your remaining debts from highest to lowest. Your hierarchy will determine the order you pay off accounts in the coming months.</p><h3>3. Making minimum payments on other debts</h3><p>While you’re putting additional money toward your highest-interest debt, only make the minimum payment on each of your other debts. Don’t fall behind or miss payments, as this would hurt your credit score, but instead, do the bare minimum to keep each of your other accounts current and in good standing. Any additional cash you have each month should be put toward the debt with the highest interest until it’s paid off.</p><h2>Benefits of the debt avalanche method</h2><p>“The debt avalanche method makes sense financially,” says Melanie Musson from Clearsurance. “You minimize the amount of money you waste on interest when you pay off the highest interest debt first.”</p><p>Aaron Razon, a personal finance expert and writer for Coupon Snake, adds: “The most outstanding benefit of the debt avalanche method is not just the fact that it helps you save on interest payments, but that it also helps you realize how much money you are losing on interest payments over time, and in my experience, I have found that this realization plays a crucial role in an individual's financial decisions. The truth is that just very few people understand how much financial progress their debt load is costing them.”</p><h3>Interest savings over time</h3><p>How much you’ll save in interest depends on how much you can put toward each payment each month. The more money you put toward your monthly payments, the better. You can use an online debt calculator to see how much you can save and how long it will take to pay off based on different monthly payments.</p><h3>Faster debt repayment</h3><p>By focusing all of your additional resources on your highest-interest debt first, not only will you save more money in interest, but you also might get out of debt faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Because each person’s budget is unique, enter your balances, minimum payments, and interest rate information into a debt payoff calculator. Determine your total budget for monthly debt payments. The calculator will tell you how long it will take you to get out of debt, and it will tell you how much you’ll save over time by using the debt avalanche method.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-create-a-budget\">How to Create a Budget: A Step-By-Step Guide</a></p><h3>Improved financial health</h3><p>You’ll see a few benefits from paying off your debts. The first is that you’ll have more cash each month as various debts are paid off. As you lower your overall debt, your credit score will improve, and you’ll be able to put more money into savings. Whether you’re building a rainy day fund, planning an upcoming vacation, or saving for your retirement, you'll have more money to put toward your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>A higher credit score will be useful if you need to take out a large loan in the future, such as to buy a house.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:222286":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"222286","content":"<p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-save-money\">How To Save Money: Strategies for Every Budget</a></p><h2>Debt avalanche vs. debt snowball: Which is right for you?</h2><p>You may have also heard of the debt snowball method — both the snowball and avalanche techniques help you pay off debt faster. The debt snowball method takes a different approach to paying off debt that you may want to consider.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key differences between the methods</h3><p>The avalanche method focuses on paying off the debts with the highest interest first. Once it’s paid off, you shift your extra monthly payments to the debt with the next highest interest rate.</p><p>The <a href=\"/personal-finance/debt-snowball-method\">snowball method</a>, on the other hand, focuses on paying off the debt with the lowest balance. Once it’s paid off, take the monthly payment that would have gone toward it and pay off the next lowest balance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pros and cons of each approach</h3><p>“The debt snowball method gives you quick wins, which can help keep you motivated,” says Joseph Camberato, CEO and founder of National Business Capital. “Paying off small balances one by one feels rewarding and gives you momentum. But the downside is that it's usually the more expensive route. Focusing on small debts first means your high-interest debt keeps racking up charges, which could cost you way more in the long run. If one of those smaller debts has a high interest rate, it can quickly spiral into a bigger problem.\"</p><p>The opposite is true for the debt avalanche method. While you’re saving money, it can take time to gain momentum, especially if your highest-interest debt also has one of your higher balances.</p><h3>Choosing the best strategy for your situation</h3><p>You can use either of these methods or a combination of both, depending on your financial goals. You may have one or two smaller debts that would be quick and easy wins and provide additional money you could put toward your highest-interest debts once they’re paid off.&nbsp;</p><p>You can still be flexible, but the most important step is to develop a strategy. Use a debt calculator or speak with a financial adviser if you feel overwhelmed. The <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> has information about what to look for in credit counseling, as well as reputable online sources to help you search for a counseling service.</p><p>You may also want to consider a <a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">debt consolidation loan</a> or a <a href=\"/mortgage/refinance-mortgage-to-pay-off-debt\">mortgage refinance</a>.</p><h2>Tips for successfully implementing the debt avalanche method</h2><p>If you’re following the debt avalanche method, you need to create a plan and rank your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. Once you’ve done that, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Create a realistic budget</h3><p>Set aside money for unexpected expenses. You may have to pick up dinner one night, or you may have to spend a little more on groceries. Expect hiccups. Give yourself enough wiggle room in each of your spending categories so that the additional cash you put toward your debt is manageable for the long term.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Stay disciplined with payments</h3><p>It may be easier during some months to throw all of your additional cash at your debts, while it may be a struggle during other months. Stick to the plan as closely as you can, but know that there may be rough patches along the way. The key is to remain consistent. If you set a realistic budget at the outset, that will help you maintain consistency and reach your goals.</p><h3>3. Monitor progress regularly</h3><p>It’s important to keep track of your progress to help keep yourself motivated and to help ensure you're doing what’s best for your financial situation. You may want to play around with some debt payoff calculators as each debt is paid off to see if the numbers still add up. Remember, there can be flexibility.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319282":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319282","content":"<p>Cash advance apps, also called loan apps, make it easy to get small short-term loans, fast, regardless of your credit score.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors. Albert could be a good fit if you plan on taking out multiple advances a month, can repay your advance quickly, and already have an Albert account.</p><h3>Brigit's Instant Cash</h3><p><strong>Best for</strong> <strong>frequent cash app users who would benefit from optional due-date extensions</strong> and Brigit's credit-building and protection tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> $25 to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> $8.99 or $15.99 monthly membership fee</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> Free for $15.99 subscribers or $0.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>Brigit's best features are its due date extensions and <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">credit-building</a>, budgeting, and credit and identity protection tools included with membership. The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee. Brigit might be the right fit for you if you need smaller cash advance amounts, want the protection of due-date extensions, and will use the app's available tools.</p><h3>EarnIn's Cash Out</h3><p><strong>Best for users who need frequent access to relatively large cash advances</strong> and don't mind waiting one to three business days to avoid fees.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $150 per day each pay period, up to $750 per pay period; limits increase to $1,500 per pay period if you have a qualifying EarnIn deposit account</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> No, but the app asks for tips</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> $2.99 to $5.99</li></ul><p>EarnIn was the only instant-money app in our research that gives you daily access to cash advances.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost. If the maximum $8.99 fee for external accounts is <i>per</i> $100 advanced, this would be one of the most expensive apps in this list. Also, you have to sign up to access customer service via chat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Possible Finance</h3><p><strong>Best if</strong> <strong>you need more than two weeks</strong> to pay the money back.</p><ul><li><strong>Advance amounts:</strong> Up to $500</li><li><strong>Membership or per-advance fee:</strong> Per-advance fee of $10 to $25 for every $100 borrowed or a percentage of your advance, depending on your state</li><li><strong>Fee for instant advances:</strong> None</li></ul><p>Possible Finance's payday loan alternative has two strengths: You can repay your cash advance in four installments over approximately eight weeks, and advances are typically available instantly (but can take up to five days). The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live. Because the fees are so high, payday loan borrowers often find themselves taking a new advance to pay back their old advance, which creates a cycle of debt, says Nia Adams, executive director at financial wellness consultancy Perspectives.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319330":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319330","content":"<h3>Payday alternative loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">Payday alternative loans</a> (or PALs) are small, low-cost loans offered by some federal credit unions. Interest rates are capped at 28% on both types of PALs:</p><ul><li><strong>PAL I:</strong> You can borrow between $200 and $1,000 and repay it in 1 to 6 months.</li><li><strong>PAL II:</strong> You can borrow up to $2,000, with no minimum loan amount, and repay it in 1 to 12 months.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Similar to small bank loans, membership is required to get a payday alternative loan. You can apply for a PAL I 1 month after joining. With a PAL II, you can apply immediately after joining.</p><h3>Title loans</h3><p>Using the title to your car to secure a loan can provide a quick way to get cash, but it can also be expensive and risky. Car title loans may be due in 30 days, in some states, and fees can equate to triple-digit APRs. If you default, the lender can repossess your vehicle.</p><p>Similar to payday loans, rolling over a title loan can literally mean buying time.

Lender requirements can vary, but the process of applying and securing a home loan is generally the same across most private lenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Before approving a home loan, lenders assess your financial health to determine whether you can afford the loan and are likely to repay it. The mortgage qualification process typically includes the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Prequalification:</strong> Many lenders allow potential borrowers to prequalify for a mortgage loan. During prequalification, lenders perform a less stringent review of your finances to determine how much you can borrow. Afterward, lenders provide estimated loan interest rates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan application:</strong> Prequalification doesn't guarantee approval. You must formally submit a loan application, which includes sharing detailed personal and financial information with the lender.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> The underwriting process is a thorough analysis of your financial health and personal details, including your creditworthiness, income, and assets.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Approval or denial:</strong> Once the lender processes your application, you'll receive an approval or denial based on the lender's assessment.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In some cases, you can prequalify or get <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-to-get-preapproved\">pre-approved for a home loan</a> online within minutes. Loan decisions can take a few weeks up to 60 days or longer.&nbsp;</p><p>You can potentially speed up the process with some advanced research and planning. This starts with reviewing your credit profile, evaluating your current financial situation, gathering personal information, and collecting the documents you'll need during the loan application process.&nbsp;</p><h2>Check your credit score and credit report</h2><p>It's important to understand your credit profile before you begin applying for a home loan. Lenders use your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/how-credit-score-impacts-mortgage-rate\">credit score</a> to assess how likely you are to repay the loan. Your credit report contains detailed information used by lenders during the underwriting process, including your payment history, number of credit accounts, and negative marks, which could be red flags.&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:204306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"204306","content":"<p>Some banks and credit card issuers offer free credit score access.

Review your report for any errors or fraudulent information. File a dispute with the credit bureau if you find any inaccuracies that are hurting your credit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Review your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</h2><p>Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) measures how much of your monthly income goes toward paying debts. DTI is one of the factors lenders use to determine if you can afford additional debt from a mortgage.&nbsp;</p><p>To calculate your DTI:</p><ul><li>Add up all monthly debt payments, such as credit cards, auto loans, and student loans</li><li>Divide the total by your gross monthly income</li></ul><p>Lenders generally prefer a DTI below 36%, though <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/fha-vs-conventional-loan\">FHA loans</a> may accept DTI ratios up to 50% in some cases.

No-interest loans exist in various forms, such as “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) apps and cash advance apps. However, “no-interest” or “zero-interest” doesn't necessarily mean zero cost.</p><p>These loans may come with strings attached, and in some cases, could cost more than a loan that charges standard interest. Here's a closer look at 0% interest loans and what you need to know.</p><h2>Is it possible to get an interest-free loan?</h2><p>Yes, it's possible to get interest-free loans, but most are for short-term financing needs and need to be repaid within two weeks to a few months. Loan amounts are typically limited as well. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\"><strong>Buy now, pay later</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some retailers and financial services companies offer BNPL options. As long as you make payments as agreed — often in four biweekly payments — you can avoid paying interest. However, BNPL loans may charge fees for late or missed payments.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Apps like Earnin and Klover use your next paycheck as collateral to lend small amounts of cash. These apps typically don't charge interest but may have fees, such as a monthly membership or instant transfer fees. More importantly, because of short repayment periods and fees, the cost of using a cash advance app could be the equivalent of paying more than 300% APR.</li><li><strong>Payroll advance financing:</strong> You might be able to get a paycheck advance or earned wage access through your employer. These advances may not be 100% interest-free, but if interest is charged, it's typically much lower than other short-term options such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a> and <a href=\"/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\">pawnshop loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Payment plans from healthcare providers or organizations:</strong> Healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and physicians' offices, might be willing to create an interest-free payment plan for you to encourage payment. Healthcare payment financing services offer loans or lines of credit with no or low interest, although some might charge deferred interest.</li><li><strong>Educational scholarships and emergency student loan programs:</strong> Some schools offer interest-free emergency student loans or interest-free scholarships through financial aid offices and scholarship programs. However, loan amounts may be small, and a co-signer may be required.</li><li><strong>Carmaker auto financing:</strong> Occasionally, some car manufacturers may offer interest-free 0% financing on new cars. Only those with very good or excellent credit are likely to get approved for 0% APR financing.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\"><strong>0% APR credit cards</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some credit card issuers offer introductory 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers, with introductory periods lasting up to 21 months before the regular APR applies. Remember that you'll need to pay for the purchase or balance transfer in full before the introductory offer ends to avoid interest.</li></ul><p>Some credit cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, that is added to the card's balance. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% balance transfer fee would cost $150.</p><p>If you're a student, ask your school about emergency student loans. For example, the Marshall University Emergency Loan Program provides one loan of up to $250 per semester if you have a financial emergency.</p><p>Moreover, nonprofits like the Jewish Free Loan Association offer emergency, business, education, and wellness loans with 0% interest or fees to all types of borrowers. You can get up to $15,000 for a personal emergency loan with two qualified guarantors.

However, they may involve meeting certain conditions, such as repaying within a short timeframe to avoid interest or paying fees. Terms typically range from a couple of weeks to 21 months, but high-ticket items, like cars, may have terms of 48 months or more.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, say you purchased a new car for $30,000 with a $5,000 down payment and 0% financing for 48 months. Paying off the remaining $25,000 balance would mean making 48 monthly payments of $521. Although you can avoid interest with a 0% APR financing if you repay on time, missed payments could lead to cancellation of the zero-interest offer. You would then pay the regular APR on the remaining balance.</p><p>Another example is using a BNPL loan to purchase a $1,000 smartphone. With the typical BNPL loan, you’d pay $250 upfront and agree to make three more biweekly payments of $250. You’ll likely be charged a late fee if you&nbsp;miss a payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Both these examples might truly be no-cost loans. But some no-interest loans are high-cost. For example, say you use a cash app to advance $150 from your next paycheck. You want the money today, so you pay an instant-transfer fee of $5. Since the loan is due in two weeks, the cost is equivalent to an 87% APR.

To create your FSA ID, navigate to the “<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch\">Create an Account</a>” page on StudentAid.gov.</p><p>To create your FSA ID, you’ll need your:</p><ul><li>Social Security number</li><li>Full name</li><li>Date of birth</li><li>Email address or phone number</li></ul><p>You only need to create an FSA ID the first time you complete the FAFSA. If you’re a dependent student (most undergraduates are), one of your parents will also need their own FSA ID.</p><h3>2. Gather required documents</h3><p>Once you’ve created your FSA ID, it’s time to gather the required documents for the FAFSA. You’ll need to provide information about yourself, your family, and your finances. Here are the necessary identification documents you will need:</p><ul><li>Social Security number</li><li>A parent’s Social Security number, if you are a dependent student</li><li>Your driver’s license number, if you have one</li><li>Your Alien Registration Number, if you are not a U.S. citizen</li></ul><p>Necessary financial documentation includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Federal income tax information</strong> for yourself, your parents (if you’re a dependent student), or your spouse (if you’re married). You’ll input tax information from two years prior — on the 2026-27 FAFSA, for example, you would provide 2024 tax data.</li><li><strong>Records of untaxed income</strong> for you and/or your parents, if you’re a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/independent-vs-dependent-status\">dependent student</a>. Untaxed income might include:<ul><li>Child support received</li><li>Interest income</li><li>Veterans benefits</li></ul></li><li><strong>Information on other assets</strong> owned by you and/or your parents, if you’re a dependent student. You aren’t required to report the home in which you live or retirement accounts like 401(k) plans, but you should include things like:<ul><li>Savings and checking account balances</li><li>Investments, including stocks, bonds, and real estate</li><li>Business and investment farm assets</li></ul></li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289786":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289786","content":"<h3>3.

Sign and submit the FAFSA</h3><p>You can either sign your FAFSA form using your FSA ID or by printing out and signing a signature page, which you will mail to a provided address. Signing and submitting your FAFSA online will expedite the processing of your application, however.</p><p>If you’re a dependent student, you must have a parent sign the form, too.</p><p>Once you submit your FAFSA, you’ll receive an email confirmation if you provided an email address on the form.

For example, the FAFSA for the 2026-27 academic year became available a few days before Oct. 1, 2025.</p><p>The FAFSA is unusual because there are multiple deadlines you need to track. The federal government, states, and colleges can all set their own due dates, some of which are earlier than others.</p><p>Submitting your FAFSA as soon as you can will not only ensure that you don’t miss any critical deadlines, but it can also help you qualify for more funds. Some aid is finite and only distributed on a first-come, first-served basis — which means the earlier you submit your FAFSA, the more likely it is that such financial aid will still be available. For these reasons, it’s generally best to submit the FAFSA as close to the opening date as possible.</p><h3>Federal deadline</h3><p>The 2025-26 FAFSA deadline is June 30, 2026. Remember that states and colleges often have earlier deadlines, so the sooner you complete the form, the better.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289794":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289794","content":"<h3>State deadlines</h3><p>You can find your state’s student aid deadline on the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines#state\">StudentAid.gov website</a>. Many deadlines fall between October and May, and certain state grants or other awards may have their own specific deadlines listed.</p><h3>College deadlines</h3><p>In addition to the federal and state deadlines for your FAFSA submission, colleges may set their own deadlines. Make sure you contact the financial aid office of the schools you’re interested in attending to find out the due dates you’ll need to meet.</p><h2>FAFSA tips to maximize financial aid</h2><p>To make sure your submission of the FAFSA is successful, follow these important tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Double-check your information:</strong> Incorrectly typing your Social Security number or misspelling your name can derail the processing of your FAFSA. Before you hit “Submit,” make sure you check that all the information you entered is correct.</li><li><strong>Use the IRS data retrieval tool:</strong> Gathering and entering all the necessary tax information can be the most time-consuming part of this process. To speed things up and help avoid mistakes, use the IRS data retrieval tool. Not all students are able to take advantage of this tool, but if it’s available to you, it may be worth it.</li><li><strong>Don’t list assets you aren’t required to:</strong> Not all assets must be included on your FAFSA, and overreporting your wealth can lead to less financial aid. Read the fine print about what assets you’re required to include. For example, you don’t need to report:<ul><li>Your primary home</li><li>UGMA and UTMA accounts for which your parents are the custodian, but not the owner</li><li>Life insurance values</li><li>ABLE accounts</li><li>Retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, pension funds, annuities, noneducation IRAs, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Draw down assets you do have to include:</strong> You might also reallocate the assets you’re required to report, such as your savings account. If you can afford to, you could use your savings to pay off credit card debt or make a lump-sum investment in a retirement account. Actions like this can leave you with less to report on the FAFSA.</li><li><strong>Regularly check your email for updates: </strong>You don’t want to miss any important messages about upcoming deadlines or missing information. Monitor your communications and take quick action if required.</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:289798":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"289798","content":"<h2>After registering for FAFSA, what's next?</h2><p>Completing the FAFSA is not the end of your financial aid journey. Once you've submitted the form, you will have several tasks still to complete, including:</p><h3>1. Review your Student Aid Report (SAR)</h3><p>The Department of Education will send you a <a href=\"/student-loans/student-aid-report\">Student Aid Report</a> by email (if you’ve provided an email address on your application) or by regular mail. You’ll receive a SAR anywhere from three days to three weeks after you applied, depending on how you submitted the FAFSA.</p><p>As long as your application is complete, your SAR will include an <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-to-calculate-your-student-loan-expected-family-contribution-efc\">Expected Family Contribution</a>, soon to be renamed the Student Aid Index. This number is used to determine your eligibility for both federal and institutional need-based aid. Once you receive your SAR, review it in detail to make sure all the information is correct.</p><h3>2. Compare financial aid offers from colleges</h3><p>Your school will send you a financial aid letter, typically in the spring, which will officially outline all the federal, state, and school aid that you qualify for. This can include federal student loans, work-study opportunities, grants, and scholarships. Compare the aid packages from each school you’ve been accepted into in order to determine which will be the best fit for your academic and financial needs.</p><p>Make sure you compare apples to apples when you look at the various offers. For example, you may get more financial aid from one school, but if it costs more to attend than other schools, it may still be cheaper to go to a school offering less aid.</p><h3>3. Accept or decline aid</h3><p>You don't have to accept all the financial aid that’s offered to you. In general, it’s wise to apply for and accept as many scholarships and grants as you can, since this kind of aid generally doesn’t have to be repaid.</p><p>You’re also not required to accept federal student loans, or accept the full amount that you qualify for. Determine how much you need to borrow, if any, and whether to decline any aid offered to you.</p><p>If you have maxed out your federal aid and still need extra funding to afford school, you might consider <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a>. While these don’t come with the same protections as federal loans, they often have higher borrowing limits and can be a useful way to bridge any funding gaps.</p><h3>4. Renew the FAFSA each year</h3><p>The FAFSA is not a one-and-done submission: You must renew it each year you enroll in school to maintain your eligibility for student aid.</p><p>Thankfully, renewing the FAFSA is a shorter process than the initial application. You’ll simply need to log in to FAFSA.gov with your FSA ID, update any prefilled information that’s changed, provide updated income and tax information, and then sign and submit the form.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">Find Your Student Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:230250":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"230250","content":"<p>A mortgage comes with many costs, both upfront and over time.

For a $1,000,000 mortgage, this could be between $100,000 and $200,000.</p><h3>What salary do I need to afford a $1,000,000 mortgage?</h3><p>One guideline suggests borrowers can afford a house roughly two to three times their annual salary. For a $1,000,000 home, this would be a salary of about $200,000 to $333,000 a year. You can also get a more detailed look by comparing your monthly income and housing expenses. Experts suggest you spend no more than <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-08/borrowing-money-how-much-mortgage-can-i-afford.pdf\">28% of your monthly gross income</a> on housing costs. If you multiply your monthly income by 0.28, you can find your ideal monthly payment and use that to shop around for the right mortgage. For example, a $250,000 salary divided by 12 months would give you a pre-tax income of about $20,833 per month; 28% of that would be $5,833.24.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:26414":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"26414","content":"<h2>Monthly payments for different mortgage amounts</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:62718":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"62718","content":"<h2>Mortgage calculators&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator\">Mortgage Payment Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">Home Affordability Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/loan-to-value-calculator\">Loan-to-value (LTV) Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/piti-mortgage-calculator\">PITI Mortgage Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/how-much-can-i-borrow\">Borrowing Power Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-prequalification\">Mortgage Pre-qualification Calculator</a><br>&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:318150":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"318150","content":"<p>Student loan debt can be a burden on households.

Only private lenders offer refinancing — therefore, this option is best for borrowers with private loans, because refinancing federal student debt means giving up <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/federal-student-loan-benefits\">borrower benefits</a> like access to loan forgiveness.</p><p>Each private lender has its own eligibility requirements that you must meet. This can present a challenge for those without high earnings, since many lenders have a minimum income requirement.</p><h3>Minimum income requirements can be hard to meet</h3><p>“Refinancing any loan can be hard for low-income earners,” explains Domenick D'Andrea, a financial adviser and co-founder of DanDarah Wealth Management. “Most lenders have minimum income requirements, but this number will vary depending on the lender.” These minimums create challenges if your income is too low.</p><p>Lenders not only look at how much you earn, but at your debt relative to your income. “Debt-to-income ratio tells the lender if you have the money to pay the loan — that's the critical piece that many people forget,” says Jack Wang, a wealth adviser specializing in student loan repayment with Innovative Advisory Group.</p><p>Lenders take all your debt into account too. This includes not only your student loans, but also factors like any credit card debt you may have. So, if you have a lot of other debt, that makes refinancing even more challenging.</p><p>D'Andrea says that lenders will also look at your employment history to make sure your income is stable, which could be a problem if you've only recently found work or if you work as a freelancer.</p><h3>Your credit history also matters</h3><p>Income is one key component that private lenders look at when deciding if you can refinance. Credit is another.</p><p>“Credit score tells the lender if you pay your bills on time,” Wang says. Unfortunately, if you have more limited income, it can be easier to fall behind on payments and find yourself with a low credit score, which also makes qualifying harder.</p><p>D'Andrea notes that you usually need a good credit score to refinance. Typically, this means a FICO credit score of at least 670. However, it's important to shop around if you have imperfect credit, as some lenders are more willing to provide loans than others.</p><p>“All of these are guidelines and vary lender to lender, so do your research and find the lender that best matches your need,” says D'Andrea.</p><h2>Strategies to qualify for refinancing with a low income</h2><p>There are strategies for refinancing even with a limited income. Some options include:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a cosigner to get approved or get better terms:</strong> Private student loan lenders often allow you to add a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner</a> to your application. This is a person who agrees to share responsibility for your debt. If you can find someone with a higher income and solid credit to cosign, you may get approved with more lenders at better rates.</li><li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong> Since lenders look at both <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/credit-score\">credit</a> and income, a better score makes you a less risky borrower. Lenders may be more willing to overlook your low income if you have excellent credit.</li><li><strong>Reduce other debts:</strong> Paying down other debts helps you to lower your debt-to-income ratio, which makes qualifying easier.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of refinancing student loans for low-income earners</h2><p>If you can find the right lender for your situation, there are significant benefits to refinancing student loans. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Lower your monthly payments: </strong>Refinancing your loans can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-monthly-student-loan-payment\">lower your monthly payment </a>if you extend your repayment term. A lower monthly payment provides more wiggle room in your budget.</li><li><strong>Reduce your interest rate for long-term savings: </strong>You can potentially get a lower interest rate when you refinance, which makes your cost of borrowing cheaper. This can also help you pay off your loan faster.</li><li><strong>Make repayment more manageable: </strong>When you refinance, you combine multiple loans into one new loan. This makes it easier to keep track of payments, since you only have a single student loan and one monthly payment.</li></ul>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:15786":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"15786","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:318162":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"318162","content":"<h2>Drawbacks of refinancing for low-income earners</h2><p>There can be some downsides to refinancing as well.

You give up these benefits if you refinance federal loans. Most low-income borrowers are better off using an income-driven plan to keep payments at a set percentage of their income and eventually qualify for loan forgiveness.</li><li><strong>Potentially higher overall costs with longer repayment term: </strong>If you extend your payment term when refinancing, you'll pay more in interest and be in debt for longer, making accomplishing other financial goals more challenging.</li></ul><h2>Tips for managing student loans on a low income</h2><p>If you have a limited income, there are ways to manage your student loans that don't involve refinancing. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Budget to allocate funds toward repayment: </strong>Create a detailed budget to save money. Prioritize <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans/\">student loan payoff</a> in your budget by making cuts to things like entertainment or eating out.</li><li><strong>Explore income-driven repayment plans: </strong>If you have federal loans, look into income-driven repayment options. You can limit monthly payments to no more than 5% to 20% of your discretionary income, which could mean payments as low as $0.</li><li><strong>Communicate with your lender about financial challenges: </strong>Lenders prefer to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-repayment-help/\">work with you</a> on your student loan payment issues rather than have you default, so ask your lender what your options are.</li></ul><h2>How to choose a student loan refinance lender if you have a low income</h2><p>If you're <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">refinancing student loans</a> with a low income, some key features to look for when choosing a private student loan lender include:</p><ul><li>Lower income thresholds</li><li>Affordable interest rates and flexible repayment timelines so you can select the loan that's right for you</li><li>Timely cosigner release, which will allow you to apply with a cosigner and then remove the cosigner after you make a certain number of on-time payments</li><li>Autopay discounts for making payments on time, which can reduce borrowing costs</li></ul><h2>How to apply for student loan refinancing with low income</h2><p>To apply for a refinance loan with a low income:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around with different lenders: </strong>Check each lender's minimum income and credit score requirements to see if you qualify and to find out which offers the best rates.</li><li><strong>Find a cosigner if possible: </strong>If you can find a cosigner with a higher income and strong credit, you'll have a better chance of loan approval.</li><li><strong>Gather your documents: </strong>You'll need personal information, financial information, and details about the loans you're refinancing.

Weigh the following factors carefully:</p><ul><li><strong>Approval requirements:</strong> Different lenders require different <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">credit score minimums</a>, debt-to-income ratios, income, and more. If you don't have good credit, look for lenders that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit loans</a> to borrowers with credit scores at or below 580.</li><li><strong>APR:</strong> Prequalify to compare potential APRs from multiple lenders. The higher the rate, the more you'll pay.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> In addition to interest, there may be fees to look out for, such as <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> or late payment fees. Consider these added costs when comparing lenders. Note that origination fees are typically charged upfront and reduce the loan amount you receive.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\"><strong>Loan amount</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Personal loans often range from a few thousand dollars to around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a>, though it varies by lender. If you need to borrow a larger amount, there are some lenders, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bhg-personal-loans-review\">BHG Financial</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/sofi-personal-loans-review\">SoFi</a>, that fund up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000</a> or more.</li><li><strong>Customer satisfaction and service:</strong> A personal loan is a major financial commitment, so you should work with a lender you trust. Customer reviews on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> and&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau website</a> can help you get a sense of different lenders' reputations and customer service.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> Some lenders may take up to a week to fund your loan, while others can do so the same day you apply. If you need loan funds fast, look for <a href=\"/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">lenders that offer fast or same-day funding</a>.</li><li><strong>Ability to cosign or co-borrow:</strong> If you have bad credit, a low income, or a high DTI, you may want to apply for a <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\">personal loan with a cosigner</a> or a joint personal loan with a co-borrower.

Luckily, you have several alternatives that may be more cost-effective or offer faster funding, different loan amounts, or more convenience. Below are some common personal loan alternatives:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit cards:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Credit cards</a> provide a revolving line of credit you can borrow against and repay each month. If you carry a balance, you'll be charged interest — likely at a higher rate than with a personal loan. If you can pay off your balance within the card's grace period (typically one billing cycle), you could borrow interest-free.</li><li><strong>Home equity financing:</strong> If you own a home, you may be able to borrow against your home equity with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loan</a> or <a href=\"/personal-loan/heloc-vs-personal-loan\">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a>. These options often have lower interest rates compared to personal loans, but they come with additional risk. If you default on the loan, you can lose your house. Since your home needs to be appraised, it also takes much longer to approve and fund.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Offered by federal credit unions, PALs allow credit union members to borrow up to $2,000 with repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 months. These loans are much more affordable than traditional payday loans — APRs are capped at 28%. You can't take out more than 3 loans over a 6-month period.</li><li><strong>“Buy now, pay later” (BNPL) loans:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL loans</a> are short-term installment loans you can use to split up purchases into multiple payments. Some BNPL loans don't charge interest but come with late fees for missed payments. Others are similar to traditional personal loans, with APRs up to 36%. These loans are often available online, but you can use them in stores, too.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/loan-apps\"><strong>Cash advance apps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These apps let you borrow against your next paycheck. They don't charge interest, but most request tips and charge fees to send funds instantly.

Prequalification won't affect your credit score, but remember that it provides estimates of rates and terms rather than offers of credit. You'll need to formally apply to get a loan offer, and the hard credit check typically required for a loan application could lower your credit score by up to 10 points for as long as 1 year.</li><li><strong>Compare quotes:</strong> Once you've prequalified, compare potential rates and terms. Then, choose a lender based on customer reviews and the company that has the lowest interest rate, fees, and loan term that works best for you.</li><li><strong>Decide how much you need to borrow:</strong> Borrowing more money than you need is financially risky and could also affect your chances of qualifying. Consider your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) and how much additional debt you can afford to take on. For personal loans, lenders typically prefer that you have a DTI below 36%.</li><li><strong>Apply:</strong> You'll need to provide basic information, such as your Social Security number, monthly income, and monthly rent or housing payment.</li><li><strong>Provide any documents your lender needs:</strong> <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-requirements\">Requirements vary by lender</a>, but you may need to provide documentation to prove your employment and income, like tax returns, bank statements, pay stubs, or proof of address. You'll also need to provide proof of your identity, such as a driver's license or passport.</li><li><strong>Sign for the loan and receive funds:</strong> If you're <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-approved\">approved for a loan</a>, you'll sign a loan agreement. Then, the lender will send your loan funds, typically by&nbsp;<a href=\"\">direct deposit</a> <a href=\"\">to your bank account</a>.

These accounts offer tax advantages for families who set aside money specifically for education expenses. Contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses like tuition, fees, books, and room and board.</p><p>You can open a 529 plan through your state or a financial institution. In some cases, your state may even offer a tax deduction or credit for contributing to its plan.</p><h3>Scholarships and grants</h3><p>In addition to savings, you can reduce your college costs by applying for financial aid. The most valuable type is free aid, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/get-scholarship-for-college\">scholarships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/college-grants\">grants</a>. Federal grants are available through programs like the Pell Grant, while colleges and private organizations may offer additional scholarships or need-based awards.</p><h3>Part-time work</h3><p>While many students <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/best-jobs-for-college\">work during college</a> to help pay for tuition, Kantrowitz advises limiting your work hours, if possible. While it sounds counterproductive to lower your earnings during your college years, Kantrowitz notes that students who work full-time are less likely to graduate compared to those who work 12 hours or less.</p><p>Another option is the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-work-study\">federal work-study</a> program. This form of financial aid allows eligible students to earn money through part-time jobs while in school. Work-study is typically reserved for students with financial need, and the money earned doesn't have to be repaid.</p><h3>Tuition reimbursement programs</h3><p>If you're already in the workforce, check whether your employer offers a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/what-is-tuition-reimbursement\">tuition reimbursement program</a>. Some companies provide tax-free benefits to help cover the cost of tuition, books, and other school-related expenses, and in some cases, even student loan repayment.</p><p>Under IRS rules, employer-paid educational assistance is tax-free up to $5,250 per employee per year. That limit applies to both tuition and student loan repayment benefits combined. Any amount above that becomes taxable.</p><h3>Student loans</h3><p>Another common way to pay for college is with student loans. The federal government offers two main types: <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">subsidized and unsubsidized loans</a>. Subsidized loans are for students with financial need, and they don't accrue interest while you're in school, which can help keep your total costs lower. Unsubsidized loans start accruing interest right away, but they're one of the most accessible forms of student aid.</p><p>If federal loans don't fully cover your expenses, you can also apply for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> through banks, credit unions, or online lenders. These loans are based on your credit score and income, and they often come with higher interest rates, especially if you don't have strong credit.</p><p>Most undergraduates need a cosigner to qualify for a private loan. In fact, 84% of borrowers who applied for a private student loan in 2024 did so with a cosigner, according to data from the Credible marketplace.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:299438":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"299438","content":"<h2>What to know before taking out student loans</h2><p>Student loans are one of the most common <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/How-to-Pay-for-College\">ways to pay for college</a>, but they're also one of the most expensive.

This can help you gauge how much you can afford to repay right out of school.</li><li><strong>Avoid overborrowing: </strong>Borrow only what you need to cover tuition and mandatory expenses to avoid paying more in interest than you need to.</li><li><strong>Stay on top of your loan's repayment details: </strong>Pay attention to your lender's policies on grace periods, deferment, and interest accrual to ensure you know exactly when loan repayment begins and what's expected of you.</li></ul><p>Adam Cardona, founder and licensed massage therapist at Elite Healers Sports Massage, also underscored a common mistake that massage students often make, and how to mitigate it.</p><p>“Some underestimate the time it takes to build a client base, assuming they'll earn top dollar immediately,” says Cardona, who encourages massage students to create and stick to a budget.</p><p>“They should apply for every scholarship available. Starting with part-time work while in school can help them enter the field without financial stress,” he adds.</p><h2>Cost of massage therapy school</h2><p>According to the American Institute of Alternative Medicine, massage therapy school tuition ranges from $5,000 to $30,000. How much you'll spend on massage therapy training is highly variable, depending on factors like your institution, program length, and location.</p><p>Keep in mind that this range doesn't include other miscellaneous expenses that you'll need for the job. Textbooks, licensing exam fees, insurance, uniforms, massage tables, laundry, and sanitation supplies are just a few additional costs.</p><p>Massage therapy programs are generally broken down by total training hours; the number of training hours you're required to complete for certification is defined by your state's regulations. According to the American Massage Therapy Association's <a href=\"https://www.amtamassage.org/globalassets/documents/publications-and-research/2024-amta-research-report.pdf\">2024 Massage Profession Research Report</a>, massage therapy students reported completing an average of 639 hours of initial training in 2023.</p><p>“In the past few years, I've seen that massage therapy graduates are taking on some loan debt. This debt is usually between $20,000 and $30,000 for a 24-month degree and their New York State license,” says Cardona.</p><p>“Other states require about $10,000 to $15,000 for training and certification. Vocational programs are shorter and cheaper than traditional degrees. However, job placement can vary,” he explains.</p><h2>Salary for massage therapists</h2><p>The median annual wage for massage therapists was $57,950 in May 2024, with the top 10% of therapists earning more than $97,450, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/massage-therapists.htm#tab-5\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Income in this field is highly variable. Your years of experience, local market, and work setting — whether at a luxury wellness spa, medical office, or massage franchise, for example — all contribute to your earning potential.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:275866":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"275866","content":"<p>More than 1.1 million international students studied in the U.S. during the 2023-24 academic year, according to the <a href=\"https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-students/\">Open Doors 2024 Report on International Educational Exchange</a>.

This will help the lender figure out if you can cover the monthly mortgage payment.</p><p>Check your online accounts for your most recent billing statements, or contact each lender for a copy. You’ll need these to show your financial obligations:</p><ul><li>The most recent mortgage statement on the home you’re refinancing and any other properties you own.</li><li>The most recent billing statement for any outstanding home equity loans or lines of credit.</li><li>The most recent monthly statement for accounts listed on your credit reports, such as student loans, car loans, personal loans, and credit cards.</li><li>Any debts that aren’t listed on your credit reports, such as payday loans.</li></ul><h2>Statement of assets</h2><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Your lender will need to check whether you have the funds to cover the closing costs on the new mortgage.

For individual borrowers, P2P lending can mean better approval odds, especially if you have fair credit.

That’s the easiest way to see if it’s a fit. However, the company also provides the following borrower eligibility guidelines.&nbsp;</p><h3>Credit score and financial history</h3><p>Prosper’s minimum credit score is 640. Eligibility also depends on your financial history, although specifics aren’t mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p>If you apply with a&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">co-applicant</a>, they should have at least fair credit, at least one open trade on their TransUnion credit report, and no bankruptcy filings within the last 12 months.&nbsp;</p><h3>Income and employment</h3><p>Prosper considers monthly income and monthly expenses, but no specific requirements are given on how much you have to earn. Lenders typically consider your monthly income and debt to gauge the monthly payment amount you can afford.</p><h2>Prosper personal loan purposes</h2><p>Prosper offers personal loans for a wide range of purposes. When you fill out the prequalification form, you can choose from options including:</p><ul><li>Debt consolidation</li><li>Home improvement</li><li>Auto, motorcycle, RV, boat</li><li>Household expenses</li><li>Large purchase</li><li>Medical/dental</li><li>Taxes</li><li>Vacation</li><li>Special occasion</li><li>Other</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:245534":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"245534","content":"<p>The majority of Prosper’s personal loans (69.8%) are taken out for&nbsp;debt consolidation, according to the company’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prosper.com/Downloads/Legal/Prosper_Prospectus_2024-12-13.pdf\">2024 prospectus</a>. Home improvement is the next most common specified purpose (10.2%), followed by financing medical or dental procedures (2.8%). “Other” accounts for 17.2%. There aren’t many mentions of restrictions, except that you can’t use the loan funds to finance postsecondary educational expenses.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prosper personal loan fees and penalties</h2><p>Along with Prosper’s more lenient eligibility requirements come origination fees, but you won’t have to worry about early repayment penalties.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan origination fees</h3><p>Prosper <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">charges&nbsp;origination fees</a> that range from 1% to 9.99%. These are one-time fees that get deducted from the loan amount upfront. For example, if you get a loan for $20,000 and it has a 5% origination fee, Prosper would deduct $1,000 and send you the remaining $19,000. You’d then repay the whole $20,000, plus interest.&nbsp;</p><h3>Early repayment penalties</h3><p>Paying off a personal loan early often reduces your interest costs. As a result, some lenders charge early repayment fees. However, Prosper doesn’t. You can pay off your loan at any time throughout your term without a penalty. You’ll also be eligible for a partial refund of the origination fee if you were charged more than 5%.</p><h2>How Prosper compares to other lenders&nbsp;</h2><p>Prosper is one of the more flexible personal loan lenders in the market.

If you meet the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements\">basic eligibility requirements</a>, read on to learn how to take out federal student loans.</p><h3>1. Submit the FAFSA</h3><p>Students must submit the<i> </i>Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/how-does-fafsa-work\">FAFSA</a>, every year they need federal financial aid. Your school uses your FAFSA to determine the amount of financial aid you qualify for, which can include:</p><ul><li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> You may qualify for scholarships — which don't need to be repaid - based on academic achievements, talent, and more.</li><li><strong>Grants:</strong> If you demonstrate financial need, you might be eligible for grants, as most grants are need-based. Similar to scholarships, grants are gift aid that doesn't need to be repaid.</li><li><strong>Work-study:</strong> Through this program, you can qualify for part-time employment to earn money for your educational expenses.</li><li><strong>Federal student loans:</strong> You may qualify for different types of federal student loans. Undergraduates with a demonstrated financial need may be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you\">Direct Subsidized Loans</a>, which have an interest subsidy while you're in school, for the first 6 months after you graduate, and during periods of deferment. Undergraduate and graduate students may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/what-is-a-federal-direct-unsubsidized-loan\">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>, which don't have a financial need component. Graduate and professional students may receive <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/grad-plus-loans\">PLUS loans</a>.</li></ul><p>You'll need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch\">create an FSA ID</a>&nbsp;to submit the FAFSA, and you must include your personal information and your parents or spouse's information, if applicable. The process typically takes less than an hour to complete. Go to <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\">StudentAid.gov </a>to fill out and submit the form.</p><p>After submitting your application, you'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR), which is a summary of your information. It also includes your estimated eligibility for federal financial aid.</p><h3>2. Review your financial award letter</h3><p>Once your FAFSA is processed and your schools have received it, you'll receive a financial aid award letter from the school(s) that accept you. Your award letter will typically include:</p><ul><li>The types of financial aid you're eligible for</li><li>The amount of financial aid you're offered</li><li>Your expected costs</li></ul><p>If you've applied and been accepted to different colleges, compare aid offers and total costs.</p><h3>3. Accept or decline your award</h3><p>When you're ready, accept or decline your award. It's a good idea to first accept any grants and scholarships, as this is often considered \"free money.\" Then you can accept any work-study offer and federal student loans. Subsidized loans should be your first choice, before moving on to unsubsidized loans.</p><p>You may get an offer for more loans than you need. Calculate what you need and only borrow up to that amount. When you accept federal student loans, you must sign the Master Promissory Note (MPN),<i> </i>a legally binding document stating that you agree to repay your loans.</p><p>Additionally, you must complete entrance counseling, which outlines your responsibilities with repayment and how interest and your loans work.</p><h2>How to take out private student loans</h2><p>After maxing out your federal financial aid, like grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, you might realize you're still at a deficit. If savings, part-time work, or work-study opportunities can't fill the gap, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> are an option. Here's how to take out private student loans and get the funding you need.</p><h3>Research private lenders</h3><p>Private student loans are available through financial institutions, such as <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/bank-loans\">banks</a> and credit unions, and online lenders. When looking for private lenders, cast a wide net. Research various private lenders and compare the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong> Every lender has a different set of eligibility requirements. Review the requirements to make sure you qualify. See if there is a minimum credit score requirement or a <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/cosigner-for-student-loan\">cosigner option available</a>.</li><li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> While federal loans have fixed rates, you may choose either fixed or variable interest rates with private student loans, depending on the lender. Many lenders publish the typical ranges available to borrowers, so you can get an initial idea of what each lender offers.</li><li><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> The term on your private loan refers to the length of your repayment. The number of years you have to repay your private loans ultimately affects your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">monthly payment </a>and interest over the life of the loan. Research the different repayment terms available from each lender.</li><li><strong>Hardship options:</strong> Private student loans generally have fewer benefits and much less flexibility than federal loans. Check to see if the lender offers hardship options, such as deferment or forbearance. This can help if you lose your job or face financial hardship and need to pause your student loan payments.</li><li><strong>Borrower benefits:</strong> Research any potential discounts or perks available to borrowers.</li><li><strong>Customer reviews:</strong> Since you get to choose your private student loan lender, check out their customer reviews on <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> (BBB) website.</li></ul><h3>Compare rates/prequalify</h3><p>Many lenders allow you to see your potential rate through the prequalification process. In most cases, you can find out if you prequalify with only a soft pull on your credit, which doesn't impact your credit score. Keep in mind that this isn't a final offer, and you may qualify for different rates and terms when you formally apply. Go through this process with multiple lenders and compare rates.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:3022":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"3022","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:192774":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"192774","content":"<h3>Submit an online application</h3><p>After completing your research, choose a private loan lender with competitive rates and favorable terms.

These loans are more accessible since they're available to both undergraduate and graduate students.

Max out federal loans first in all cases, since you'll get various repayment options and benefits, including access to student loan forgiveness.

Repayment is deducted from your bank account when your next paycheck is deposited. Payday loans have been widely criticized by lawmakers and consumer advocates because of exploitative costs and lending practices&nbsp;— APRs commonly range up to and over 400%, depending on your state.

Whether that's paying a vet bill, paying rent, buying groceries, or getting a needed car repair, a same-day loan can help you cover a range of unexpected or emergency expenses.</p><p>There can be some restrictions on what you can use the funds for, however, depending on the type of loan. For instance, when you apply for a personal loan, you need to tell the lender how you intend to use it, and may be obligated to use the funds for that purpose only. You also aren't generally allowed to borrow money for illegal activities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're concerned about restrictions, talk to the lender before applying.</p><h2>How to compare loans</h2><p>Given that there are different types of same-day loans and different purposes for getting one, there are a few factors to consider when deciding between them.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:288334":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"288334","content":"<p>The most important feature to compare between same-day loans — aside from how quickly the lender can make the funds available — is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a>. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is a measure of how much the loan costs on an annual basis, accounting for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees. This is important because some zero-interest or no-interest loans charge steep fees relative to the amount borrowed and the timeline for repayment, which can make them much more expensive and difficult to repay than an interest-charging personal loan.</p><p>For example, you might borrow $250 via a cash app and have the money deposited into your account instantly. But since most cash apps charge instant transfer fees or fees to expedite delivery, you’d need to account for that in the total cost of the loan. A regular personal loan calculator won’t get you there, but you can use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> or another calculator for short-term loans to figure out the APR.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Amount borrowed:</strong> $250</li><li><strong>Instant transfer fee:</strong> $5.99</li><li><strong>Payment due in two weeks</strong></li><li><strong>APR:</strong> 62.5%</li><li><strong>APR with $5 tip:</strong> 114.6%</li></ul><p>The 62.5% APR associated with the cash advance above makes this an expensive way to borrow&nbsp;— it’s even more expensive if you add a tip.

Note the lender’s same-day funding cutoff time.</li><li><strong>Complete the application early:</strong> You’ll <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">complete your application</a> directly on the lender's website. Do this as early as is feasible so you can get money today.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%.

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Large loan amounts available</li><li>Autopay and direct pay discounts</li><li>Same day funding</li><li>Long loan terms available</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not transparent about minimum credit score requirements</li><li>5,000 minimum loan amount</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>$5,000 to $100,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>2 -

For instance, when you apply for a personal loan, you need to tell the lender how you intend to use it, and may be obligated to use the funds for that purpose only. You also aren&#x27;t generally allowed to borrow money for illegal activities. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you&#x27;re concerned about restrictions, talk to the lender before applying.</p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-to-compare-loans">How to compare loans</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Given that there are different types of same-day loans and different purposes for getting one, there are a few factors to consider when deciding between them.</p></section><div class="mb-32"><div class="styles_tableContainer__Twqrz"><table class="styles_table__sCSsc"><thead><tr><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Factor</strong></section></div></th><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Description</strong></section></div></th><th colSpan="1"><div class="styles_tableHead__buw4V styles_body__wG6cR styles_semiBold__25tTb"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Example/Detail</strong></section></div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=""><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum borrower requirements</strong></section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="credit-score-for-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Minimum credit score</a>, income, and debt-to-income (DTI) requirements</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Know whether the lender will check your credit and whether you can meet its minimum requirements.</section></div></td></tr><tr class="styles_odd__qt0G5"><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Fees</strong></section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R"><a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="origination-fee.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Origination fees</a>, expedited funds fees, and late fees</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Origination fees and expedited funds fees are commonly charged upfront and increase the APR.</section></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">APR (annual percentage rate)</strong></section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Expresses the cost to borrow on an annual basis</section></div></td><td class="styles_tableCell__eWJFg" colSpan="1"><div class="styles_cellData__UdvF6"><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S styles_tableCellContent__iEi0R">Accounts for the interest rate (if one) and upfront fees.

The APR, or annual percentage rate, is a measure of how much the loan costs on an annual basis, accounting for both the interest rate and any upfront lender fees.
