    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A personal loan is a type of loan that you can get within days or hours from some banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Loan funds are typically deposited in your bank account and can be used for almost anything, such as paying for a vacation, wedding, home improvements, or consolidating debt."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I get a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To&nbsp;get a personal loan, you’ll generally need a reliable source of income, a credit score that meets the lender’s minimum requirement — many lenders prefer a FICO score above 670 — and a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) under 36%. But different lenders have different eligibility criteria. For example, some lenders consider applicants with&nbsp;fair and&nbsp;bad credit, while others only consider applicants with&nbsp;good credit&nbsp;or better."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When will personal loan interest rates go down?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged this week, a sign that lower personal loan interest rates may not be on the horizon in the near future.The federal funds rate is the benchmark rate that determines how much it costs for banks to lend money to one another overnight, which in turn affects how personal loan rates are set. In setting rates, the Fed aims to find a balance between controlling inflation (higher rates) and promoting economic growth (lower rates).Credible personal loan data for the week ending January 25 showed average rates on 3-year loans and 5-year loans at 13.06% and 18.46%, respectively. While lower by about 2 to 3 percentage points since this time last year, average rates have yet to show a sustained, significant decline since the Fed approved three rate cuts in the final months of 2025.The Fed's next rates meeting is scheduled for mid-March. Keep an eye on personal loan rates in the coming weeks as lenders and markets continue adjusting to changes in the economic landscape.Read More: The Fed’s Effect on Personal Loan Rates Explained"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the pros and cons of a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Pros:Can be used for most purposes, including&nbsp;emergency expenses, home improvements, and&nbsp;debt consolidationLarge loan maximums are available to certain borrowersCan have quick funding (the same day you apply, in some cases)Most are unsecured (no&nbsp;collateral&nbsp;required)Years-long repayment termsMay be able to prequalify and compare potential ratesCan be used to build creditCan be refinanced (e.g., if you improve your credit score and become eligible for a lower rate)Cons:Potentially high annual percentage rates (APRs) for those with fair and bad creditApproval may be difficult without good credit and a low DTIDebt may be unnecessarySome lenders charge origination fees, which can reduce the amount you receive"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I compare personal loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To compare personal loans, start by figuring out how much money you need, what you need it for, and the repayment period you want. Next, prequalify with multiple lenders that offer the terms you need. It won’t affect your credit, but formally applying for a loan may temporarily ding your score. Compare APRs, fees, and available discounts to choose the&nbsp;best personal loan&nbsp;for your situation. You can use a&nbsp;personal loan calculator&nbsp;to estimate monthly payments based on different loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment terms."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a personal loan affect your credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Personal loans&nbsp;impact your credit score&nbsp;in a few different ways. When you apply for a personal loan, the lender will conduct a hard inquiry, which may lower your score by a few points for up to a year. However, adding a personal loan to your credit mix could increase your score if you make payments on time. If you get a personal loan to&nbsp;consolidate credit card debt, your score could increase significantly because your credit utilization will drop once you pay off your cards. Just be sure to keep the cards open, with balances low, and make timely payments on the loan."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the alternatives to a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While a personal loan can be a great way to get much-needed funds, it may not always be the best option. Personal loan alternatives include:Home equity loansHome equity lines of credit (HELOCs)Credit cardsPersonal lines of creditCash advance apps (small loan amounts)Payday alternative loans (PALs) from a credit unionCash-out refinances (home or car)Cash-value life insurance loans401(k) loansBorrowing money from friends and familyThe best choice will depend on what you can qualify for and what you intend to use the loan funds for."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I refinance a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It may be possible for you to refinance a personal loan. If your credit score has improved, for example, you might qualify for a personal loan at a lower rate than the one you currently have. Or, if you need to lower your monthly payment, you could potentially do so even at the same rate by extending your repayment term. Some lenders, such as&nbsp;SoFi, offer the option of refinancing your current loan.Check your credit regularly — your bank or credit card company may let you do this for free. If you see your score increase, prequalify with multiple lenders to find out if you should refinance to get a lower rate. You may also be able to refinance at a lower rate if interest rates drop."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to get a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You could get a personal loan as soon as the same day you apply, depending on the lender you apply with, what time of day you apply, and how quickly your application is approved. That said, many online lenders will fund your loan within one to two business days of approval. In some cases — especially with lenders that use AI underwriting — approval decisions can be nearly instant.However, with others, such as some banks and credit unions, approval could take days or longer. To speed up the application process, it’s best to ensure you’ve entered all your information correctly in the application and to have documentation ready for the lender, such as a driver's license, pay stubs, and tax returns.Learn More:&nbsp;How Long Does It Take To Get a Personal Loan?"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"According to the&nbsp;Federal Reserve, the average APR on a two-year loan from a bank is 11.65%. But what you’ll be able to qualify for depends on your credit score and the repayment term you choose. The higher your score, the lower your rate is likely to be. Shorter repayment terms often convey lower rates as well.According to Credible prequalification data, average personal loan rates for borrowers with FICO credit scores of 720 or higher were 13.06% APR for 3-year loans and 18.46% APR for 5-year loans for the week ending January 25.Learn More:&nbsp;Best Low-Interest Personal Loans"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much of a personal loan can I get?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Each lender has different loan maximums, and how much of a loan you’ll qualify for with each lender is dependent on your credit, income, and current debt. For example, some lenders offer loans up to $100,000 or more, but only to well-qualified borrowers, usually those with&nbsp;excellent credit&nbsp;(a FICO score above 800) and a strong income.Learn More:&nbsp;How Much of a Personal Loan Can I Get?"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does a personal loan hurt your credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Applying for a personal loan typically requires a hard credit inquiry, which can temporarily ding your score, while missed or late payments can hurt your score significantly. But making consistent on-time payments can improve your credit over time, as payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score. Plus, if you’re using the loan to consolidate credit card debt, your score could improve dramatically once your cards have been paid off.Learn More:&nbsp;How Does a Personal Loan Affect Your Credit Score?"}}]}

Lenders are required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to display APRs instead of interest rates, so that you can better compare overall loan costs. If the lender charges no upfront fees, the interest rate and APR are the same. Fees that are avoidable, like late fees or insufficient funds fees, are not expressed in the loan’s APR.</p></section></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__0pNmZ"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="more-details-on-the-best-personal-loan-lenders">More details on the best personal loan lenders</h2></section></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

funding, and long loan terms, plus discounts for autopay and direct pay. Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate.

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="styles_paddingWrapper__xi_iL"><div class="styles_otherDetails__C6QcA"><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan amount</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$10,000 to $50,000</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Repayment terms</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>3 to 6 years</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Fees</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Origination fee: 0% to 2%</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Discounts</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>None</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Eligibility</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Available in all 50 states</p></div></div></div><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Min. income</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Does not disclose</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Customer service</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Phone</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Soft credit check</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Yes</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Time to get funds</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p><span style="color:#555555;">As soon as the next business day after successful verification</span></p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan uses</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Debt consolidation, home improvement, self-employment, and other purposes</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="styles_paddingWrapper__xi_iL"><div class="styles_otherDetails__C6QcA"><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan amount</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$2,000 to $50,000</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Fees</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Origination fee, late fee, unsuccessful payment fee, check processing fee</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Discounts</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>None</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Eligibility</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Available in all states except DC, IA, VT, and WV</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Min. income</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>$3,500</p></div></div></div><div class="styles_column__Ypfj0"><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Customer service</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Phone, email&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Soft credit check</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Yes</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Time to get funds</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>As soon as 1 to 3 business days after successful verification</p></div></div><div class="styles_otherDetail___W7u6"><p class="styles_otherDetailTitle__liAuu">Loan uses</p><div class="styles_overviewTextContent__bPAnZ"><p>Credit card refinancing, debt consolidation, home improvement, and other purposes</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><div class="LenderRatingCard_credible_lenderRatingCardTheme__0SFVJ"><div class="styles_advertiserContainer__WOT0F"><span class="styles_trigger__YbX_S " tabindex="0"><p class="AdvertiserDisclosure_disclosure__dm7jb">Advertiser Disclosure</p></span><div class="styles_crawlableContent__GKk_X"><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__liHnc AdvertiserDisclosure_disclaimer__nDOYW"><p class="parseOptions_pClassName__0CAXu mb-16 text-content">We receive compensation from the companies below if you purchase a product.

At a minimum, make sure you:</p><ol class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Can afford monthly payments for the&nbsp;duration of the loan’s term: </strong>Do you plan to leave your job before the repayment period is up? Will you be adding other expenses to your budget that could make it hard to cover payments down the line?</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Are paying a reasonable APR based on your credit score and income:</strong> Only borrowers with exceptional credit are eligible for sub-10% APRs, very good and good credit borrowers generally get rates in the mid-teens, fair credit rates are typically over 20% APR, and bad credit rates are often over 30% APR.&nbsp;</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Actually need the money:</strong> If you don’t need the money or item you’re purchasing, don’t borrow. Saving up for big purchases is often a better way to go.</li></ol><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">While that covers the basics, there are a number of scenarios in which a personal loan may not be the best choice. Here are a few:</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="when-another-borrowing-option-is-better">When another borrowing option is better</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Personal loans are best for mid-length borrowing needs — between two and seven years — when you don’t have or want to secure the loan with collateral (like your home or car). But other loan types can be more cost-effective, especially if you can pay them off over a short period or if you’re willing and able to provide collateral. For instance:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Credit cards:</strong> Credit cards generally let you borrow interest-free for the span of one billing cycle (roughly 30 days), making them the go-to for very short-term borrowing. Many also provide longer 0% APR promotional periods if you can qualify — often between 12 and 21 months. If you’re confident you can pay off the amount you need within an interest-free period, that’s likely a better choice.&nbsp;</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Home equity loans and HELOCs:</strong> If you own your home and have sufficient equity to qualify (often at least 15%), you could get a much lower interest rate with a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. However, you’re required to secure the loan with your home, which means it’s at risk if you can’t make payments. If you use a home equity loan or HELOC to make improvements to your home, you may be able to deduct the interest payments on your tax return.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="you’ll-apply-for-a-mortgage-within-the-year-(with-an-exception)">You’ll apply for a mortgage within the year (with an exception)</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Unless you’re consolidating&nbsp;credit card debt, it’s often best to avoid applying for any new credit before you apply for a mortgage. This is because when you apply for most loans, a hard credit pull is recorded on your credit report, which can drag your score down up to 10 points. In turn, this could increase the rate you get on a mortgage.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">But if you use an installment loan (and not another credit card) to consolidate credit card debt, you could substantially lower your credit utilization. This, in turn, could increase your credit score more than enough to offset the hard credit check. Another benefit is that you could potentially lower your monthly payment, thereby reducing your DTI (debt-to-income ratio) — which could help you get a lower rate or larger loan amount on a mortgage.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="you-want-to-consolidate-debt-but-can’t-get-a-lower-interest-rate-(with-an-exception)">You want to consolidate debt, but can’t get a lower interest rate (with an exception)</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Generally, you should only replace one loan (or loans) with another if you can save money. So, if you can’t, it doesn’t make sense to. The exception is if you can’t afford to make your monthly payments. In that case, it could make sense to accept a higher interest rate with a longer repayment term to avoid credit damage from missing payments. You also might want to mix and match in this case — only consolidate your higher interest debts and keep the low-rate loans.&nbsp;</p></section></div><div class="DynamicBlocks_contentWrapper__Nb5Kw"><div><h2 class="MultiSection_multiSectionHeading__MJ0_b secondary700 large bold mb-32" id="how-much-do-personal-loans-cost">How much do personal loans cost?</h2><section class="TextContent_bodyContent__0pNmZ"><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">The cost of a personal loan depends primarily on your credit score, the length of the repayment term, and how much you borrow.

According to 12 months of <a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/personal-loan/personal-loan-statistics" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Credible personal loans data</a>, less than 1% of borrowers with bad credit were able to prequalify for a personal loan. So how are the bad-credit borrowers who do qualify able to? There are a few steps that can make a big difference:</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="-improve-your-credit-score"><span style="color:#014452">1. Improve your credit score</span></h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A FICO score closer to 580-669 (fair credit) could make you eligible for a loan with more lenders. For instance, OneMainFinancial requires a minimum FICO score of 540, while Reprise requires a minimum 550 FICO score. And if you can breach the fair credit boundary, you could be eligible for a loan with lenders such as Avant, Universal Credit, and Upgrade.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Start by checking your credit report for errors — if a paid account has been misreported, for example, file a dispute with the bureau reporting the error. Otherwise, practice good credit habits by paying debts on time and keeping your credit utilization low. On-time payments can lead to score improvements within six months.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="-reduce-your-debt-to-income-ratio"><span style="color:#014452">2. Reduce your debt-to-income ratio</span></h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">It may seem counterintuitive, but if there’s a way for you to pay down debt before you apply for a loan, you could improve your chances of qualifying. Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) represents the percentage of your income that goes toward debt — add up all your minimum monthly debt payments and divide that by your total monthly income (before taxes). The lower your DTI, the better. A DTI above 50% could be a red flag that might lead to a loan denial, especially if paired with bad credit.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F" id="-apply-with-a-cosigner-or-co-applicant"><span style="color:#014452">3. Apply with a cosigner or co-applicant</span></h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A cosigner and co-applicant are not the same thing, but either can help you qualify for a loan.&nbsp;</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Cosigner:</strong> This is someone who doesn’t take out the loan with you but guarantees that you’ll repay it.

They have equal access to the loan funds and share responsibility for repayment. You might take out a joint personal loan with your spouse, for example, to finance home repairs or improvements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Lenders that allow cosigners</a> on loans are not common, but a few exist. <a class="TextContent_link__qBmHe styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm secondary700" href="/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Joint loans</a>, however, are more widely available. Either way, the lender considers the other person’s income, credit score, and debt along with yours.

Credible also works with network Partners like AmONE, <a href="/lending-partners" target="_blank">Alternative Providers</a>, and non-lender providers such as Accredited Debt Relief who offer loans and other products with different rates and terms than described here. Rates presented include lender discounts for enrolling in autopay and loyalty programs, where applicable. Actual rates may be different from the rates advertised and/or shown and will be based on the lender’s eligibility criteria, which include factors such as credit score, loan amount, loan term, credit usage and history, and vary based on loan purpose. The lowest rates available typically require excellent credit, and for some lenders, may be reserved for specific loan purposes and/or shorter loan terms. The origination fee charged by the lenders on our platform ranges from 0% to 15%. Each lender has their own qualification criteria with respect to their autopay and loyalty discounts (e.g., some lenders require the borrower to elect autopay prior to loan funding in order to qualify for the autopay discount). All rates are determined by the lender and must be agreed upon between the borrower and the borrower’s chosen lender. For a loan of $10,000 with a three-year repayment period, an interest rate of 7.99%, a $350 origination fee and an APR of 10.43%, the borrower will receive $9,650 at the time of loan funding and will make 36 monthly payments of $313.32, assuming your lender deducts the origination fee from the offered loan amount. Assuming all on-time payments, and full performance of all terms and conditions of the loan contract and any discount programs enrolled in included in the APR/interest rate throughout the life of the loan, the borrower will pay a total of $11,279.43. As of March 3, 2022, none of the lenders on our platform require a down payment nor do they charge any prepayment penalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prequalified rates are based on the information you provide and a soft credit inquiry. Receiving prequalified rates does not guarantee that the Lender will extend you an offer of credit. You are not yet approved for a loan or a specific rate. All credit decisions, including loan approval, if any, are determined by Lenders, in their sole discretion. Lowest rate advertised is not available for all loan sizes, types, or purposes, and assumes a very well-qualified borrower with an excellent credit profile. Not all lending partners who participate on the Credible Marketplace are available at a given time. Some options may be unavailable due to periodic product testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>To check the rates and terms you may prequalify for, Credible conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. If you choose a lender and continue with your application, the lender will usually conduct a hard credit pull that may impact your credit score.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing involve using a new loan to pay off your existing balance. This does not eliminate debt, but replaces one debt with another. While personal loan rates generally are lower than credit card interest rates, you may pay more in origination fees and interest over the life of the loan depending on other loan terms. Please consult a financial advisor to determine if refinancing or consolidating is right for you.</p></div><div class="styles_disclosureFlex__g3oVs"><div class="styles_disclaimer__ptzSB"><p><sup>3</sup><a href="/disclosures/personal.disclosure.sofi" target="_blank">SOFI Disclaimers</a></p></div><span class="styles_divider__t0nus">|</span><div class="styles_disclaimer__ptzSB"><p><sup>4</sup><a href="/disclosures/personal.disclosure.lightstream" target="_blank">Lightstream Disclaimers</a></p></div><span class="styles_divider__t0nus">|</span><div class="styles_disclaimer__ptzSB"><p><sup>5</sup><a href="/disclosures/personal.disclosure.ldc" target="_blank">LendingClub Disclaimers</a></p></div><span class="styles_divider__t0nus">|</span><div class="styles_disclaimer__ptzSB"><p><sup>6</sup><a href="/disclosures/personal.disclosure.bhg" target="_blank">BHG Disclaimers</a></p></div><span class="styles_divider__t0nus">|</span><div class="styles_disclaimer__ptzSB"><p><sup>7</sup><a href="/disclosures/personal.webpage.citi" target="_blank">Citibank Disclaimers</a></p></div></div></div><div class="hidden-md hidden-lg hidden-xl"><div class="disclosures-section styles_collapseSection__s5iqn"><input id="disclosures" type="checkbox" name="disclosures" data-sharkid="__4"><label for="disclosures" class="undefined styles_arrow__rTtqd " tabindex="0"><p class="styles_caption__l4qAc styles_viewDisclosure__i0g8t">View Disclosure</p></label><div class="styles_disclosuresContent__Kj02Q styles_collapseContent__TkQqW"><div class="styles_disclosures__8oElu"><div><p><sup>1</sup>Personal Loans Rate and Terms Disclosure: Rates for personal loans provided by lenders on the Credible platform range between <span>6.49%</span> - <span>35.99%</span> APR with terms from 12 to 120 months.

Many also provide longer 0% APR promotional periods if you can qualify — often between 12 and 21 months.

Available loan amounts are relatively low at $25,000, and the minimum repayment term is relatively high at three years. The lender also charges origination fees, does not offer discounts, does not consider income from self-employment, and is not available nationwide.

But other loan types can be more cost-effective, especially if you can pay them off over a short period or if you’re willing and able to provide collateral. For instance:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredit cards:\u003c/strong\u003e Credit cards generally let you borrow interest-free for the span of one billing cycle (roughly 30 days), making them the go-to for very short-term borrowing. Many also provide longer 0% APR promotional periods if you can qualify — often between 12 and 21 months. If you’re confident you can pay off the amount you need within an interest-free period, that’s likely a better choice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHome equity loans and HELOCs:\u003c/strong\u003e If you own your home and have sufficient equity to qualify (often at least 15%), you could get a much lower interest rate with a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. However, you’re required to secure the loan with your home, which means it’s at risk if you can’t make payments. If you use a home equity loan or HELOC to make improvements to your home, you may be able to deduct the interest payments on your tax return.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eYou’ll apply for a mortgage within the year (with an exception)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnless you’re consolidating\u0026nbsp;credit card debt, it’s often best to avoid applying for any new credit before you apply for a mortgage. This is because when you apply for most loans, a hard credit pull is recorded on your credit report, which can drag your score down up to 10 points. In turn, this could increase the rate you get on a mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if you use an installment loan (and not another credit card) to consolidate credit card debt, you could substantially lower your credit utilization. This, in turn, could increase your credit score more than enough to offset the hard credit check. Another benefit is that you could potentially lower your monthly payment, thereby reducing your DTI (debt-to-income ratio) — which could help you get a lower rate or larger loan amount on a mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eYou want to consolidate debt, but can’t get a lower interest rate (with an exception)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, you should only replace one loan (or loans) with another if you can save money. So, if you can’t, it doesn’t make sense to. The exception is if you can’t afford to make your monthly payments. In that case, it could make sense to accept a higher interest rate with a longer repayment term to avoid credit damage from missing payments.
