Plus, average rates on LightStream personal loans were the lowest among all Credible partner lenders for borrowers with good, very good, and excellent credit, according to 12 months of Credible personal loans marketplace data. There are no origination fees or other fees, and loans can be used for a wide range of purposes Funds can be available as soon as the same day you apply, and you could have up to 20 years to repay certain types of loans, including home improvement loans, RV loans, and boat loans.  Unlike most lenders, LightStream does not let you prequalify on its site — but you can prequalify through Credible.

Plus, SoFi offers live chat and free financial advice for customers. Unlike many other online lenders, SoFi is an FDIC-insured bank, which means SoFi makes loans directly and does not partner with a third-party to originate loans. It also means that you could have your checking, savings, and loan accounts all in one place.  To qualify for an unsecured loan, it's best to have good credit. But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate.

While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos.

The platform offers loans from a wide range of lenders, and next-day funding is available. Loans are available up to $100,000 if you apply via Splash’s website. Rates are competitive, but borrowers with excellent credit may find lower APRs elsewhere.

You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher. However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process.

While this online lending platform is legitimate and backed by FDIC-insured banks, borrowers with good credit may find lower rates elsewhere.</p><h3>Best fast loans for fair credit</h3><p>If you apply for a Universal Credit personal loan through Credible, you'll need at least a 580 credit score. For fair-credit borrowers who need a personal loan fast, Universal Credit could be the solution. The average funding time for Universal Credit personal loans was 2 days, according to Credible marketplace data over a 12-month period. Universal Credit's average funding time compared favorably with those of other fair-credit lenders, including Avant (3 days), Reach Financial (3 days), and LendingClub (4 days).&nbsp;</p><p>Universal Credit also offers personal loans for several purposes, including debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, and home improvement. If you use your loan for debt consolidation, Universal Credit offers a direct pay discount for sending the loan funds to your creditors. However, be aware that debt consolidation could increase the time needed to fund the loan, since it involves the lender connecting with creditors as well as the borrower.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/debt-consolidation-loans-for-fair-credit\">Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Fair Credit</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:274162":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"274162","content":"<h3>Great for small loans</h3><p>Universal Credit offers $1,000 loans, which is a lower loan amount than what is offered by many of its competitors.

Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of this lender:</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:274170":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"274170","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Quick funding:</strong> You can receive loan funds as soon as one business day after you’re approved and complete all verifying documents.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Small loans available: </strong>While Universal Credit offers loans up to $50,000, it also offers loans as low as $1,000. Many competitors do not.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fair credit borrowers may be eligible: </strong>A typical minimum credit score for most lenders is in the 640 range — good credit, per the FICO scoring model — but Universal Credit's minimum requirement is lower.</li><li><strong>Long loan terms available: </strong>Universal Credit offers repayment terms as long as seven years (if you apply through Credible), which can significantly reduce monthly payment amounts.</li><li><strong>Debt consolidation money can be sent directly to creditors:</strong> This makes paying off debts quick and easy; it also keeps you from using loan funds for other purposes.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>High origination fees:</strong> All loans are charged an origination fee, which can be as high as 9.99%. This is higher than what many other personal loan lenders charge, and will reduce the amount you have available to spend or pay off creditors.</li><li><strong>High APRs</strong>: Even on the low end, Universal Credit’s APRs are higher than many other competitors.</li></ul><h2>How to qualify for a Universal Credit personal loan</h2><p>To qualify for a personal loan with Universal Credit, here are the minimum requirements:</p><ul><li>Be at least 18 years old (or 19 if you live in Alabama)</li><li>Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or possess a valid visa</li><li>Have a valid email address</li><li>Provide a verifiable bank account</li></ul><p>Additionally, Universal Credit may check the items below to assess your financial suitability for a personal loan.</p><h3>Credit score and financial history</h3><p>Universal Credit performs a soft credit check when you apply for a personal loan. This means checking your rate will not affect your credit score. However, if you accept the loan, the lender will perform a hard inquiry, which could ding your score for up to one year.&nbsp;</p><p>Universal Credit does not publish a minimum credit score requirement on its website, but you should have a FICO score of at least 580 to qualify through Credible. The company does take your creditworthiness into account when determining your eligibility and loan terms.</p><h3>Income and employment</h3><p>Universal Credit requires a minimum annual income of $25,000. During the final review of your loan, Universal Credit may request documents to verify your income and employment. This will prove you have the ability to repay the loan.</p><h2>Universal Credit personal loan purposes</h2><p>Universal Credit personal loans can be used for many purposes, including:</p><ul><li>Debt consolidation</li><li>Home improvements</li><li>Wedding planning&nbsp;</li><li>Emergency medical bills&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While you can use Universal Credit personal loans for a wide variety of purposes, there are a few prohibited uses to be aware of. These include anything related to post-secondary education (tuition, room, board, books, etc.), criminal activity, investments, or gambling. When applying for a personal loan, you must state the purpose of your loan in the application.</p><p>(Note that while the “no criminal activity” element may seem like a no-brainer, be aware that cannabis-related businesses may fall in this category as marijuana is still a controlled substance at the federal level, even if it’s legal in certain states.)</p><h2>Universal Credit personal loan fees and penalties</h2><h3>Loan origination fees</h3><p>Universal Credit charges an origination fee for underwriting their personal loans. This ranges between 5.25% and 9.99% of the loan amount and is deducted from loan proceeds. So if you have a $10,000 loan and your origination fee is 7%, you would receive $9,300 when your loan is funded.</p><p>These origination fees are on the high side. Moreover, some competitors offer <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loans</a> with no origination fees at all. To get a loan with no origination fee, you should have good credit or better (a 670 FICO score or higher).</p><h3>No early repayment penalties</h3><p>Universal Credit does not charge any early repayment penalties. If you can repay your loan early, they encourage you to do so.</p><h3>Late fees</h3><p>You have a 10-day grace period when paying on your Universal Credit personal loan. But if you’re late, you’ll be charged a $10 fee.

Also, the app lets you request a seven-day repayment extension.</p><p>On the downside, the app has a short six-day repayment period, and its subscription fees are much higher than many competitors.

The app's drawbacks are that it's one of just a few instant-money apps requiring a monthly membership fee.

Additionally, the app doesn't charge a membership or per-advance fee.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyLion's biggest disadvantage is that it can take up to five business days for your money to arrive if you don't pay for an instant advance. Plus, the website isn’t clear about how much instant advances over $100 cost.

The downside is that the app charges <i>very</i> high fees for advances compared to other apps we researched.</p><p>If you don't need money instantly but want to pay back your advance in installments instead of all at once, Possible Finance could be a fit.

Additionally, Varo allows you to repay your advance within 30 days. But the app has drawbacks. Its per-advance fees can be as high as $40 for a $500 advance. New users are limited to a maximum of $250 per advance. And you have to have a Varo banking account that has received at least $800 in qualifying direct deposits in the current or previous month.

However, Dave's main drawbacks are that not all members qualify for ExtraCash, few members qualify for a $500 advance, and you have to pay both membership and per-advance fees. Dave might be a good fit if you only need cash advances once or twice a month, as the app's per-advance fee can become costly compared to other options if you need frequent advances.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319322":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319322","content":"<h2>What are cash advance apps?</h2><p>Cash advance apps are lending platforms that offer cash advances to borrowers who qualify. They can be a temporary solution for borrowers who need small amounts of cash from time to time. In general, the apps are not banks but financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") that partner with banks. For example, Albert partners with Sutton Bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash advance apps usually don't offer advances of more than $500 at a time, and repayment is typically due on your next payday.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319298":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319298","content":"<h2>How do money-borrowing apps work?</h2><p>The first step in using a money-borrowing app is to sign up — you'll typically need to link your bank account so the app can determine how much you're eligible to borrow. Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.</p><p>From there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.</p><h2>How to compare money-borrowing apps</h2><p>Comparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs. For example, if you know you'll need a cash advance in a week, how quickly an app can send you your advance may not be important. However, if you need money today, you'll want apps that offer instant or same-day advances.</p><p>Here are four criteria you should use to compare cash-advance apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Borrowing limits:</strong> The maximum amount of money you can borrow might change depending on the app you use. And, in some cases, your maximum amount will be limited at first and increase over time.</li><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Money-borrowing apps typically charge you a monthly or per-advance fee to get cash advances. If you're paid weekly and think you'll need at least a few advances per month, it makes sense to use an app with a monthly fee that's lower than what you'd pay in total for advance fees each month.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong> There's a wide range of funding times among cash advance apps. If you have a set plan for when you're taking out a cash advance, longer funding times may not be an issue. However, if you tend to use cash advances without any planning, apps offering same-day or affordable instant advances may make more sense.</li><li><strong>Borrower requirements:</strong> Just like borrowing limits, fees, and funding times, cash-advance apps have varying borrower requirements. These requirements typically focus on the frequency and/or amount of your paycheck direct deposits, which state you're in, and, in some cases, whether you've paid off an existing advance from the app. Also, some apps require you to open a deposit or debit card account with their service.</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of loan apps</h2>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:319306":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"319306","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>No late fees: </strong>Generally speaking, cash advance apps don't charge late fees.

Their <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment periods</a> are typically two to seven years. Their combination of low rates and extended repayment terms (compared to advances from money-borrowing apps) usually leads to manageable monthly payments.</p><p>Personal loans tend to be a better fit if you're looking to borrow at least $1,000. Several lenders offer loan amounts starting at <a href=\"/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000</a>, and loans of up to <a href=\"/personal-loan/50000-loan\">$50,000</a> may be available.</p><h3>Small bank loans</h3><p>Getting a loan from a bank doesn't necessarily mean tons of paperwork, getting dressed up to visit a branch office, and making an expensive long-term commitment. Some banks offer small, low-cost loans, with examples including:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance Assist from Bank of America:</strong> You can borrow up to $500 with a $5 flat fee and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a BofA checking account.</li><li><strong>Simple Loan from U.S. Bank:</strong> You can borrow up to $1,000 with a $6 fee for every $100 you borrow and repay it in three equal monthly installments from a U.S. Bank checking account.</li></ul><p>The catch is that you'll need to become a checking account customer of the bank that's providing the loan if you aren't already. The cost of a small bank loan could compare very favorably with the cost of a loan app. For example, if you borrowed $400 with a U.S. Bank Simple Loan, repaying it on schedule in three months, the $24 fee would be equivalent to paying 35.65% APR.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>Opening a credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can borrow from up to your card's limit. Credit cards tend to work best when you pay your entire bill in full. Otherwise, any leftover balance accrues interest. The average credit card interest rate was <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20250507/\">21.39%</a>, according to the Federal Reserve, making credit cards a potentially less expensive way to borrow money than cash apps.</p><p><strong>Compare: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-credit-card\">Personal Loan vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better</a></p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> should be used as a last resort, as their fees can equate to a 400% APR or more, depending on where you live.

That means there’s no risk to your credit score when you apply. Note that a hard check will be applied once you accept the loan and it's funded.</li><li><strong>Fair-credit eligible:</strong>&nbsp;Upgrade has lower&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">credit score requirements</a> than many other lenders — you could potentially get approved with a score as low as 580.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/secured-personal-loans\"><strong>Secured loan</strong></a><strong> options:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re having trouble getting approved for a standard personal loan, Upgrade lets you offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/collateral-for-personal-loan\">collateral</a>, such as your car or your home’s built-in fixtures. Because collateral that minimizes the lender’s risk, you could also qualify for a lower interest rate.</li><li><strong>Joint applications accepted:</strong>&nbsp;Another way to improve your approval odds, lower your rate, or qualify for a larger loan amount is to apply with a joint applicant, such as a spouse or family member — especially if the co-applicant has a better credit score or higher income.</li><li><strong>Fast funding:</strong>&nbsp;Upgrade can fund your loan by the next business day. And based on 12 months of Credible closed loans data, Upgrade delivered on that claim with an average 2-day funding time. That said, if you’re using an Upgrade loan to consolidate debts and having Upgrade pay your debts directly, it can take up to two weeks for the payments to process.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/small-loans\"><strong>Small loans</strong></a><strong> available:</strong>&nbsp;You can borrow as little as $1,000.

For instance, if you borrow $20,000 and are charged an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fee</a> of 9.99%, you’d receive $18,020 but would repay the full $20,000, with interest.</li><li><strong>Risk of collateral loss:</strong>&nbsp;If you take out a secured loan, you risk whatever collateral you put up. Defaulting on the loan means Upgrade can take ownership of your collateral, such as your car or home fixtures.</li></ul><h2>How to qualify for an Upgrade personal loan</h2><p>To qualify for an Upgrade personal loan, you:</p><ul><li><strong>Need a 580 credit score or higher:</strong>&nbsp;At a minimum, you’ll need a 580 credit score.

This could help you net a lower interest rate as well.&nbsp;</p><h2>Upgrade fees and penalties</h2><p>While Upgrade doesn’t charge prepayment penalties for early loan payoff, there are other fees to be aware of before taking out a loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Origination fee:</strong>&nbsp;Upgrade charges an origination fee between 1.85% and 9.99% for all personal loans.</li><li><strong>Late fee:</strong>&nbsp;If you don’t make a payment within 15 days of the due date, you’ll incur a $10 late fee.</li><li><strong>Failed payments:</strong>&nbsp;If your check doesn’t clear or you don’t have enough money in your checking account for the transaction to go through, Upgrade will charge you a $10 fee.

Academic struggles, social difficulties, and physical health issues are also common factors.</p><p>Some students take a short break with plans to return the next semester or academic year, while others step away indefinitely. The decision to return to the same school or transfer elsewhere can also affect how long a break lasts.</p><h2>How taking a break affects financial aid</h2><p>Taking time off from college can impact your financial aid, as federal aid eligibility assumes continuous enrollment.</p><p>“You're no longer eligible for federal financial aid if you drop below half-time enrollment,” says Dr. Darla Bishop, author of “How To Afford College.”</p><p>“And if your break lasts longer than six months, you will have to begin repayment on any federal student loans,” she adds.</p><p>If you return to school after a leave of absence, your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">student loans</a> will go back to “in-school deferment” status. However, taking a break can still affect your <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/how-long-to-pay-off\">repayment timeline</a>.</p><p>“If you take a leave of absence for a full year or even just a semester, the grace period will be exhausted by the end of the leave of absence, so you will not have a grace period when you ultimately graduate,” says Mark Kantrowitz, author of “How To Appeal for More College Financial Aid.”</p><p>Loans aren't the only type of aid affected by a break in enrollment. Scholarships and grants may also be at risk.</p><p>“Students who leave at the end of a semester or academic year can just decline grants or scholarships for the upcoming semester,” Bishop says. “But the rules get wonky if you leave in the middle of a semester.”</p><p>If you leave mid-semester, you may be required to repay grant and scholarship funds that were tied to your academic performance, such as maintaining a certain GPA. But there are ways to avoid this.</p><p>“Try to stay until the end of the semester or negotiate for incompletes for the term, which gives you several weeks into the next semester to complete the coursework,” advises Bishop.</p><h2>How to take a break from college</h2><p>Taking a leave of absence requires certain paperwork, even in an emergency. You'll need to understand your school's leave of absence policy and notify your school of the upcoming break.</p><p>“There's a lot of timeliness for certain types of notification,” says Bishop. “If you have to leave suddenly, you may miss a deadline, which could affect your ability to get future financial aid.”</p><p>If you're considering a leave of absence, Bishop recommends taking the following steps to prepare:</p><ol><li><strong>Meet with your academic adviser: </strong>Your adviser can walk you through your school's leave of absence policies and help you complete any required paperwork.</li><li><strong>Check with the Office of Student Affairs: </strong>This may also be called the Office of Student Services. This department can guide you through the re-enrollment process and help ensure you remain eligible for financial aid when you return.</li><li><strong>Talk to the financial aid office:</strong> A leave of absence can impact your student loans, grants, and scholarships. The financial aid office can explain how your break will affect your aid and what steps you need to take.</li><li><strong>Plan for health care and housing:</strong> If your school provides your health insurance or housing, you'll need a plan to cover these expenses while you're on leave.</li></ol>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:11066":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"11066","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:248490":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"248490","content":"<h2>Managing student loans during a college break</h2><p>Taking a break from college can affect your student loans.

Research lenders and loan options</h2><p>Before applying for a personal loan, make sure to thoroughly research your loan options. There are many <a href=\"/personal-loan\">highly rated personal loan lenders</a>, and it’s important to find one that best meets your needs.</p><p>When choosing a lender, there are generally <a href=\"/personal-loan/where-can-i-get-a-personal-loan\">three types to choose from</a>: <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">traditional banks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>. Each of these options has its own pros and cons. A traditional bank or credit union could be a good option if you already have a relationship with that financial institution, such as having your accounts there or having previously borrowed from them.</p><p>Online lenders also have some major advantages. Because they don’t have physical locations, their overhead tends to be lower, which can result in lower fees and interest rates for borrowers. Additionally, some have more lenient eligibility requirements and offer loans to borrowers with poor or fair credit.</p><p>It’s helpful to decide ahead of time what you need when it comes to your loan amount and repayment term, as well as your credit score and your desired APR. Knowing these factors upfront can help you narrow down your lender options quickly.</p><h2>4. Prequalify with multiple lenders</h2><p>Many lenders allow you to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a personal loan</a>, meaning you’ll go through a soft credit check to determine whether you’re likely to qualify for a loan and what your estimated APR, amounts, and terms are.&nbsp;</p><p>Because prequalification doesn’t negatively affect your credit score, it presents an opportunity to shop around with different lenders to see which could offer the best option for you. Just remember that a prequalification quote isn't an offer of credit.

Long-term installment loans typically provide a lump sum of money that you repay monthly; with a revolving credit line, you can draw as needed up to your limit. Types of long-term loans include mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and some personal loans.</p><p>There aren't any universal criteria for what separates a short-term loan from a long-term loan. However, since five-year maximums are common for many personal loan lenders, a loan with a repayment term longer than five years can be considered long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>When comparing personal loans, you may have multiple repayment term options.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">Personal loan repayment terms</a> typically range from two to seven years, but some personal loan lenders offer even longer repayment terms. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/lightstream-personal-loans-review\">LightStream</a> offers home improvement loans with repayment terms up to 20 years, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bhg-personal-loans-review\">BHG Financial</a> offers personal loans with repayment terms up to 10 years.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are long-term loans typically used for?</h2><p>In most cases, the appeal of a long-term loan is the lower monthly payment. Borrowers may be drawn to long-term loans when they need help paying for a costly expense, since the longer repayment term helps with budgeting. For example, you might use a long-term personal loan for:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/home-improvement-loans\">Home remodeling</a></li><li>Boat or auto purchase</li><li>Timeshare purchase</li><li>IVF or family planning</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-medical-loans\">Medical expenses</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">Debt consolidation</a></li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of long-term personal loans</h2><p>Compared with short-term personal loans, long-term personal loans have benefits and drawbacks.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312770":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312770","content":"<h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Lower monthly payments:</strong> Long-term personal loans typically have lower monthly payments than short-term personal loans, which puts less strain on your monthly budget.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Larger loan amounts:</strong> You may be able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">borrow $100,000</a> or more with a long-term loan, depending on the lender and other factors.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prepayment flexibility:</strong> Most personal loan lenders don’t charge a prepayment penalty, so you always have the option to make extra payments or repay the loan early without incurring additional fees. This strategy can help you reduce interest costs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Can help you manage large expenses:</strong> A long-term personal loan may help you pay for a large expense, such as a home renovation, that would be unaffordable under other circumstances.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>May have higher interest rates:</strong> Longer repayment terms mean more risk for lenders, which often means higher interest rates. A higher interest rate and a longer repayment term increase your borrowing costs over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Stricter eligibility criteria:</strong>&nbsp;Just as long-term loans are riskier for the borrower, they’re riskier for the lender. Lenders typically like to see higher credit scores when extending credit for a longer period of time. “If you have a lower credit score, you may only be offered short-term loans,” says Justin Moran, Founder and CEO at Payoff Genius, a financial education tool.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Could affect your ability to qualify for future loans:</strong> Lenders consider the current debt you have when deciding whether to approve you for a new loan. A long-term loan creates a debt obligation for years (unless you pay it off early), which could potentially limit your borrowing options during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312774":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312774","content":"<h2>When to consider a long-term personal loan (and when to avoid it)</h2><p>A long-term personal loan can be a lifeline under certain circumstances, but it’s not the right choice for every financial situation. Here’s how to decide if a long-term personal loan is right for you.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to consider</h3><ul><li><strong>The loan is part of a strategic plan to consolidate debt:</strong> Though long-term personal loans cost more overall than short-term loans, paying off debt with a fixed-rate personal loan can still save you a significant sum when compared to carrying a balance on a high-rate credit card. You can use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to estimate your savings.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The expense is unavoidable and unaffordable:</strong>&nbsp;It might not be possible to pay for a necessary medical procedure or auto repair from your savings. If a short-term loan would cause you to fall behind on payments, a long-term loan might be the safer option. “It is imperative that the payment be made on time and in full every month. That means setting aside that much cash and preferably setting up autopay to ensure timely payment,” says Michael Sullivan, Director of Education at Take Charge America.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The loan still has a low APR:</strong> “Go longer unless they make it worth your while. If you’re looking at two personal loans that have different terms, say three vs. five years, but they have the same or similar interest rates, I would always pick the longer one,” says Moran. “You can always pay it off faster if you want but enjoy the flexibility and lower payment when you need it.”</li></ul><h3>When to avoid</h3><ul><li><strong>You’re prone to impulse spending beyond your means:</strong> If you lack discipline with spending,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans\">credit card debt consolidation</a> may not be the best solution to the problem. “Continuing to run up debt after consolidating is a path to financial disaster,” says Sullivan. “Consumers who have a spending problem should contact a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111\">nonprofit credit counselor</a> instead of borrowing more money.”</li><li><strong>You’re nearing retirement or facing an income loss:</strong>&nbsp;Before taking out a long-term personal loan, consider your plans for the duration of the loan term. Will you be retiring or sending a child to college before the loan is fully repaid? Consider any changes to your budget that could increase the risk of default.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The expense is non-essential:</strong> Although a wedding or a dream vacation can have great sentimental value, its practical value is another story. Avoid taking on long-term debt to pay for an event or experience you'll get to enjoy just once.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Long-term vs short-term personal loans</h2><p>The table below shows how the repayment term can affect the monthly payment and total repayment cost for a hypothetical $20,000 personal loan with an 18% interest rate. Note that the longer repayment terms result in a lower monthly payment but higher total interest costs over the life of the loan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312778":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312778","content":"<p>However, keep in mind that you're unlikely to get the same interest rate on a longer-term loan. The interest rate would likely increase with the length of the repayment term, meaning that the overall interest costs in the hypothetical example above could be significantly higher. Consider the average prequalified rates on 3-year and 5-year personal loans for borrowers using the Credible marketplace:</p><ul><li><strong>3-year loans:</strong> Typically around 13%</li><li><strong>5-year loans:</strong> Typically around 19%</li></ul><h2>How to choose the right term length</h2><p>If there’s little difference in APR between two loan options, choose the longest term. Then, determine an amount you can comfortably afford to dedicate to debt repayment each month, and repay the loan at a faster pace.&nbsp;</p><p>Use this same strategy even if there’s a slight difference in the APR, says Moran. “For example, if the offer is 9.85% on a 3-year loan but 10% on a 5-year, I would take the 5-year. You can always pay it off faster if you want but enjoy the flexibility and lower payment when you need it.”</p><p>Choosing the right term length becomes more complicated if there are major differences in rates and fees. You should err on the side of flexibility, but aim for the term option with the lowest total repayment cost that still has a monthly payment you can comfortably afford.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the requirements for a long-term personal loan?</h2><p>Each lender has its own requirements, but here’s what you can generally expect when applying for a long-term personal loan.&nbsp;</p><h3>Minimum credit score</h3><p>There’s no universal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">minimum credit score for a personal loan</a>, but many personal loan lenders look for a FICO score in the mid-600s or higher. Lenders check your credit report to see how well you’ve managed your debt obligations in the past. Some lenders consider borrowers with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-fair-credit\">fair credit</a> or even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit</a>, but it may be a challenge to qualify for longer repayment terms, and the lowest rates are typically reserved for excellent credit borrowers.&nbsp;</p><p>Short-term personal loans may be easier to qualify for than long-term personal loans for borrowers with bad credit, but short-term personal loans should not be confused with short-term, high-cost loans from predatory lenders, such as payday loans, title loans, and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/high-risk-loans\">high-risk loans</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sufficient income and employment</h3><p>You’ll typically need a source of income to qualify for a personal loan, and some lenders have minimum income requirements. Also, lenders may have different requirements regarding what counts as income. You may need to upload documents like W-2s or tax returns from previous years to demonstrate stable earnings.&nbsp;</p><h3>Maximum debt-to-income ratio</h3><p>Lenders typically evaluate your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/debt-to-income-ratio\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) to determine if you can manage more debt based on your income. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your total minimum monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. Lenders tend to prefer a DTI below 36% for personal loans — anything higher is cause for concern that you might struggle to repay another loan.&nbsp;</p><p>Moran says some lenders are willing to be more flexible with debt consolidation loans, since you’re using the loan funds to reduce your existing debt. “Some lenders are willing to offer a longer term or more cash if you are willing to provide some extra info or allow the lender to pay off your debts directly,” says Moran. “There might be more options that just aren’t shown online. Try talking to the lender directly and see what they might be able to offer.”</p><h3>Other requirements</h3><p>Some lenders have specific requirements for personal loan repayment terms of a certain length, often related to loan amount or loan purpose. For example, Navy Federal Credit Union offers its longest terms for home improvement loans but has high minimum loan requirements:</p><ul><li>A $25,000 minimum loan amount for terms of 61 to 84 months</li><li>A $30,000 minimum loan amount for terms of&nbsp; 85 to 180 months</li><li>Applying with a co-applicant for loans of more than $50,000</li></ul><h2>How to compare long-term loan lenders</h2><p>When comparing long-term loan options, consider the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>APR:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan\">APR</a> (annual percentage rate) is the annual cost of the loan expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. It includes both the interest rate and any upfront fees.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Total repayment cost:</strong>&nbsp;Long-term loans offer lower monthly payments, but it can be easy to ignore the total cost of repayment over the life of the loan. Use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">loan calculator</a> to compare total interest costs between different loan terms.</li><li><strong>Funding time:</strong>&nbsp;If your expense is urgent, check how long it will take for the lender to disburse the loan funds. While funding a personal loan typically takes 1-3 business days, some lenders offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">same-day personal loans</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan restrictions and minimums:</strong>&nbsp;Pay attention to any restrictions on loan use or minimum borrowing amounts the lender requires for long-term loans.</li><li><strong>Lender reputation and customer support:</strong>&nbsp;You’ll be working with the lender for many years, so make sure it offers customer support options that meet your needs (such as live chat or phone support during convenient hours) and check customer reviews on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">Trustpilot</a> for any red flags.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Loan management tools:</strong>&nbsp;Evaluate the lender’s loan management tools, especially if your plan is to make extra payments. For example, does the lender have a mobile app that makes it easy to put extra cash toward the principal whenever you see fit, or will you need to send a check? The repayment experience may impact how quickly you repay the loan. Also, check whether the lender offers autopay and whether you can earn a discount for enrolling.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>How do long-term loans impact your credit?</h2><p>Applying for a personal loan will cause a slight dip in your credit score, and adding to your outstanding debt may also negatively impact your score. So, you might see your credit score decline at the beginning of your long-term loan repayment period, when your outstanding balance is high relative to the loan amount.&nbsp;</p><p>But your payment history is the most important factor in calculating your FICO score, and late or missed payments can cause significant damage. So, if you’re worried about your credit score, choose a personal loan repayment term with a monthly payment you can confidently afford.&nbsp;</p><p>For someone with a thin credit history, a longer-term loan may actually be beneficial. “The longer-term loan has more opportunities for on-time payments and may actually slightly help a consumer with few debts,” says Sullivan.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:312782":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"312782","content":"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Credible evaluated&nbsp;<strong>32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best long-term personal loans based on length of available loan terms, minimum and maximum interest rates, types of approved loan purposes, customer experience, origination fees, discounts, availability of secured loans, and more.

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Eligible applicants can borrow up to $250,000</li><li>No hard credit check when you apply</li><li>Considers borrowers with fair credit</li><li>Long repayment terms</li><li>Concierge service</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not available in CT, ID, IL, LA, MD, ME, MT, ND, RI, VT, or WI</li><li>No discounts</li><li>Minimum annual income requirement of $100,000</li><li>Funding takes at least five days</li><li>No direct-to-creditor payments</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>up to $250,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 -

Plus, it has a low minimum income requirement, offers repayment terms up to 6 years, and is available in all states. But If you need a loan under $10,000, you'll need to look elsewhere. While this lender may charge an origination fee, its fees are on the low side, topping out at 2%. You'll also want to have good credit to apply for a loan with Axos. You can expect to receive funds 1 to 2 business days after the loan is approved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">pros</p><ul class="mb-24"><li>Eligible applicants can borrow up to $250,000</li><li>No hard credit check when you apply</li><li>Considers borrowers with fair credit</li><li>Long repayment terms</li><li>Concierge service</li></ul><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">cons</p><ul><li>Not available in CT, ID, IL, LA, MD, ME, MT, ND, RI, VT, or WI</li><li>No discounts</li><li>Minimum annual income requirement of $100,000</li><li>Funding takes at least five days</li><li>No direct-to-creditor payments</li></ul></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Loan amount</p><div><p>up to $250,000</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetail__8hYsh"><p class="LenderTableMoreDetails_uppercase__HZLxD styles_bodySmall__vjui9 styles_bold__faN_F">Repayment terms</p><div><p>3 -

Long-term installment loans typically provide a lump sum of money that you repay monthly; with a revolving credit line, you can draw as needed up to your limit. Types of long-term loans include mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and some personal loans.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">There aren&#x27;t any universal criteria for what separates a short-term loan from a long-term loan. However, since five-year maximums are common for many personal loan lenders, a loan with a repayment term longer than five years can be considered long-term. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When comparing personal loans, you may have multiple repayment term options. <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-term-length.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">Personal loan repayment terms</a> typically range from two to seven years, but some personal loan lenders offer even longer repayment terms.

If a short-term loan would cause you to fall behind on payments, a long-term loan might be the safer option. “It is imperative that the payment be made on time and in full every month. That means setting aside that much cash and preferably setting up autopay to ensure timely payment,” says Michael Sullivan, Director of Education at Take Charge America. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">The loan still has a low APR:</strong> “Go longer unless they make it worth your while. If you’re looking at two personal loans that have different terms, say three vs. five years, but they have the same or similar interest rates, I would always pick the longer one,” says Moran. “You can always pay it off faster if you want but enjoy the flexibility and lower payment when you need it.”</li></ul><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">When to avoid</h3><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You’re prone to impulse spending beyond your means:</strong> If you lack discipline with spending, <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="credit-card-consolidation-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">credit card debt consolidation</a> may not be the best solution to the problem. “Continuing to run up debt after consolidating is a path to financial disaster,” says Sullivan. “Consumers who have a spending problem should contact a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">nonprofit credit counselor</a> instead of borrowing more money.”</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">You’re nearing retirement or facing an income loss:</strong> Before taking out a long-term personal loan, consider your plans for the duration of the loan term.

You can always pay it off faster if you want but enjoy the flexibility and lower payment when you need it.”</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Choosing the right term length becomes more complicated if there are major differences in rates and fees. You should err on the side of flexibility, but aim for the term option with the lowest total repayment cost that still has a monthly payment you can comfortably afford. </p><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="what-are-the-requirements-for-a-long-term-personal-loan">What are the requirements for a long-term personal loan?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Each lender has its own requirements, but here’s what you can generally expect when applying for a long-term personal loan. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Minimum credit score</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">There’s no universal <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="credit-score-for-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">minimum credit score for a personal loan</a>, but many personal loan lenders look for a FICO score in the mid-600s or higher. Lenders check your credit report to see how well you’ve managed your debt obligations in the past. Some lenders consider borrowers with <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="best-personal-loans-fair-credit.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">fair credit</a> or even <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="bad-credit-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">bad credit</a>, but it may be a challenge to qualify for longer repayment terms, and the lowest rates are typically reserved for excellent credit borrowers. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Short-term personal loans may be easier to qualify for than long-term personal loans for borrowers with bad credit, but short-term personal loans should not be confused with short-term, high-cost loans from predatory lenders, such as payday loans, title loans, and other <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="high-risk-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">high-risk loans</a>. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Sufficient income and employment</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">You’ll typically need a source of income to qualify for a personal loan, and some lenders have minimum income requirements. Also, lenders may have different requirements regarding what counts as income. You may need to upload documents like W-2s or tax returns from previous years to demonstrate stable earnings. </p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Maximum debt-to-income ratio</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Lenders typically evaluate your <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="debt-to-income-ratio.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) to determine if you can manage more debt based on your income. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your total minimum monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. Lenders tend to prefer a DTI below 36% for personal loans — anything higher is cause for concern that you might struggle to repay another loan. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Moran says some lenders are willing to be more flexible with debt consolidation loans, since you’re using the loan funds to reduce your existing debt. “Some lenders are willing to offer a longer term or more cash if you are willing to provide some extra info or allow the lender to pay off your debts directly,” says Moran. “There might be more options that just aren’t shown online. Try talking to the lender directly and see what they might be able to offer.”</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">Other requirements</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Some lenders have specific requirements for personal loan repayment terms of a certain length, often related to loan amount or loan purpose. For example, Navy Federal Credit Union offers its longest terms for home improvement loans but has high minimum loan requirements:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A $25,000 minimum loan amount for terms of 61 to 84 months</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">A $30,000 minimum loan amount for terms of  85 to 180 months</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Applying with a co-applicant for loans of more than $50,000</li></ul><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-to-compare-long-term-loan-lenders">How to compare long-term loan lenders</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">When comparing long-term loan options, consider the following features:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">APR:</strong> The <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="apr-vs-interest-rate-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">APR</a> (annual percentage rate) is the annual cost of the loan expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. It includes both the interest rate and any upfront fees. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Total repayment cost:</strong> Long-term loans offer lower monthly payments, but it can be easy to ignore the total cost of repayment over the life of the loan. Use a <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="personal-loan-calculator.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">loan calculator</a> to compare total interest costs between different loan terms.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Funding time:</strong> If your expense is urgent, check how long it will take for the lender to disburse the loan funds. While funding a personal loan typically takes 1-3 business days, some lenders offer <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="same-day-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">same-day personal loans</a>. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Loan restrictions and minimums:</strong> Pay attention to any restrictions on loan use or minimum borrowing amounts the lender requires for long-term loans.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Lender reputation and customer support:</strong> You’ll be working with the lender for many years, so make sure it offers customer support options that meet your needs (such as live chat or phone support during convenient hours) and check customer reviews on <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/" rel="" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Trustpilot</a> for any red flags. </li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Loan management tools:</strong> Evaluate the lender’s loan management tools, especially if your plan is to make extra payments. For example, does the lender have a mobile app that makes it easy to put extra cash toward the principal whenever you see fit, or will you need to send a check? The repayment experience may impact how quickly you repay the loan. Also, check whether the lender offers autopay and whether you can earn a discount for enrolling. </li></ul><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="how-do-long-term-loans-impact-your-credit">How do long-term loans impact your credit?</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Applying for a personal loan will cause a slight dip in your credit score, and adding to your outstanding debt may also negatively impact your score. So, you might see your credit score decline at the beginning of your long-term loan repayment period, when your outstanding balance is high relative to the loan amount. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">But your payment history is the most important factor in calculating your FICO score, and late or missed payments can cause significant damage. So, if you’re worried about your credit score, choose a personal loan repayment term with a monthly payment you can confidently afford. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">For someone with a thin credit history, a longer-term loan may actually be beneficial. “The longer-term loan has more opportunities for on-time payments and may actually slightly help a consumer with few debts,” says Sullivan.</p></section><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h2 class="mb-16 styles_medium__JhO3w styles_bold__faN_F" id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Credible evaluated <strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">32 lenders across 1,216 data points</strong> to find the best long-term personal loans based on length of available loan terms, minimum and maximum interest rates, types of approved loan purposes, customer experience, origination fees, discounts, availability of secured loans, and more.

Most cash advance apps limit their advances to $500 or less, although there are some exceptions, including Albert, EarnIn, and MoneyLion. Other apps may limit your advances to, say, $250, but increase the limit over time if you prove to be a responsible borrower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, your lender will approve or deny your cash request. If approved, the app will tell you how much cash you qualify to advance, what fees you'll pay, and when you need to repay the advance. If you accept the advance, you'll have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to receive your money. How fast you get the money typically depends on whether you send it to a bank account run by the app or an external account and/or whether you pay extra to expedite funds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to compare money-borrowing apps\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eComparing money-borrowing apps can help you find a platform with features that best meet your needs.
