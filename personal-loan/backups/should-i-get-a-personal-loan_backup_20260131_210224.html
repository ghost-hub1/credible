However, the impact is short term; hard inquiries only affect credit scores for a year, and even then, such inquiries reduce your score by less than five points.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a personal loan affect your credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>A personal loan has an immediate impact on your credit score. Applying for a loan results in a hard credit pull, which temporarily lowers your score by a few points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, responsibly managing a personal loan can have a positive impact on your credit score:</p><ul><li><strong>On-time payments:</strong>&nbsp;Make your required monthly payment on time each month, and the lender will report those on-time payments to the credit bureaus. This will increase your credit score over time.</li><li><strong>Credit mix:</strong>&nbsp;One factor affecting your credit score is your credit mix. A more diversified credit portfolio (i.e., different types of loans) can result in a higher credit score.</li><li><strong>Credit utilization:</strong>&nbsp;If you use a personal loan to&nbsp;consolidate your credit card debt — and keep those paid-off cards open — your credit utilization will decrease. And a lower credit utilization results in a stronger credit score.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind, personal loans can also hurt your credit score if you fall behind on payments.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much of a personal loan can I get?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>How much of a personal loan you can get depends on the lender and your credit history.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Borrowing amounts vary, but it’s possible to get something as small as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/1000-loan\">$1,000 personal loan</a> or as big as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/100k-loan\">$100,000 personal loan</a> (or larger), if you can qualify.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What can’t I use a personal loan for?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>You can use a personal loan for almost anything, but most personal loan agreements prohibit certain uses. In most cases, you can’t use a personal loan for:</p><ul><li>Starting a new business</li><li>Paying for tuition</li><li>Making a down payment on a home</li><li>Gambling</li><li>Illegal purchases (obviously)</li></ul>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much will a personal loan cost long-term?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>How much a personal loan costs you over time depends on three factors:</p><ul><li><strong>The APR:</strong>&nbsp;The higher the interest rate and any upfront fees, the more you’ll pay to borrow.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>How much you borrowed:</strong>&nbsp;Interest on a large loan amount results in a more expensive loan than that same interest rate on a lower loan amount.</li><li><strong>The loan term:</strong>&nbsp;A longer loan term may result in smaller monthly payments. But the longer you drag out a loan repayment, the more you’ll pay in interest overall.</li></ul><p>You can use our&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-calculator\">personal loan calculator</a> to determine how much you’ll pay in interest over the course of a loan — and the total cost of that personal loan by the payoff date.</p>"}}]}

Full-time undergraduate students spend an average of $340 on course materials per year, including textbooks, according to the College Board.</p><p>Even though textbook prices have soared, students are actually spending less. The Association of American Publishers’ “Trends in Student Spending on Course Materials” report found that spending on textbooks and course materials dropped by more than 45% in the last decade. A big reason for this decline is the rise of new formats, such as online texts and assistance programs.</p><p>“Colleges typically include the estimated cost of books in the published cost of attendance figures, but that can represent buying or renting textbooks,” says Jack Wang, wealth adviser and host of the Smart College Buyer podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>“If a family wants more specifics, they may have to reach out to the individual academic departments for details, as books and the availability of digital access can vary significantly from class to class.”</p><p>Because costs vary so much, it can be difficult to plan ahead. Fortunately, there are many ways to keep textbook expenses under control.</p><h2>Use federal financial aid</h2><p>Most students qualify for federal financial aid by completing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>. After your financial aid award is applied to tuition, mandatory fees, and housing, any leftover funds can generally be used for other education costs, including textbooks and supplies.&nbsp;</p><p>Schools that participate in the federal aid program must give students a way to access books and supplies by the first week of each term. They’re also required to refund any remaining aid within 14 days, unless you choose to apply the balance to future charges.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:279394":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"279394","content":"<h2>Apply for textbook-specific grants and scholarships</h2><p>Some schools and states offer grants or scholarships designed specifically to help with textbook costs. For example, the City University of New York (CUNY) School of Professional Studies and the University of Kansas provide textbook grants that award eligible students a $200 bookstore voucher. Check with your school’s financial aid office to see if similar programs are available.</p><p>Certain private scholarships also include textbook stipends, giving recipients extra funds to cover course materials. You can start your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans/scholarship-search\">scholarship search</a> on platforms like Fastweb.com, Scholarships.com, or the College Board’s Scholarship Search.</p><h2>Rent textbooks instead of buying</h2><p>For many classes — especially general education courses — you won’t need to keep the textbook once the course is over. Renting can be a cheaper option than buying, even compared to used books. For example, at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, rental textbooks cost 45% less than new ones, compared to just a 25% discount for used copies.</p><p>You can usually rent from your campus bookstore or third-party sites like Valore (formerly Chegg). Rental agreements outline when and where books must be returned to avoid late fees or penalties. Typically, rentals last for the length of the term and are returned to the bookstore or another designated location.&nbsp;</p><p>“Every student should contact the college they plan to attend to inquire about rental, used texts, etc.,” says Kevin Ladd, chief operating officer and co-creator of Scholarships.com. “I know a person who literally used the school printer and printed an entire book so they wouldn't have to purchase it.”</p><h2>Buy used or previous editions</h2><p>Campus bookstores often sell used textbooks and, in some cases, older editions at a discount. Previous editions are usually only one version behind the latest release and may differ only in formatting or minor updates.</p><p>According to Oklahoma State University, students can save about 25% on textbook costs by buying used. You can also find affordable options through platforms like Amazon, BookScouter, and CampusBooks. Just be sure to check with your professor before purchasing an older edition to make sure it’s acceptable for the course.</p><p>“There are times where students are required to buy the latest edition, or a book specific to a course or professor that is only available new,” says Wang. “Those instances can raise the cost.”</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:13366":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"13366","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"interactive"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:279398":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"279398","content":"<h2>Use library or digital copies</h2><p>Campus libraries often keep a limited number of textbooks on reserve in both physical and digital formats. Unlike rentals, library loans are usually short-term, so some students make copies of chapters as needed to save money.</p><p>“You may be allowed to use the school library to access free or more affordable options and/or printer access,” says Ladd. “Typically, you will be limited to the number of pages you are allowed to print, but if you have a classmate who isn't using their printer credits, you may consider asking them to use their Student ID to print more if you run out of credits.”</p><p>You may also be able to get free or low-cost materials through PDFs shared by your professor, e-textbooks, or open educational resources, which are books that are either in the public domain or published under an open license.</p><h2>Ask about inclusive access programs</h2><p>Some publishers work with colleges to give students automatic digital access to course materials for a flat fee. For example, Pearson partners with more than 980 schools to provide inclusive access programs.</p><p>These programs are usually much cheaper than buying each textbook separately. For example, at the University of California, Davis, undergraduates can pay $169 per quarter for unlimited digital access to assigned textbooks.</p><p>If you find more affordable student materials elsewhere, many programs let you opt out.</p><h2>Use private student loan funds</h2><p>If you’ve already used up textbook grants, scholarships, and federal aid for the term,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> can help fill the gap.

What's right for someone else might not be the right solution for you.</p><h2>10 things to consider</h2><p>Here are factors to consider regarding your financial planning with student loans:</p><h3>1. Financial cushion</h3><p>Do you have a solid emergency fund of three to six months' worth of expenses? If the answer is no, building a financial cushion is more of an immediate need. An emergency fund can help you handle surprise situations that inevitably come up.</p><h3>2. Interest rates</h3><p>Compare the <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">interest rates</a> on your student loans versus the expected return on your investments. Typically, you want to focus on the higher number for maximum impact.</p><h3>3. Student loan type</h3><p>Federal student loans tend to have lower interest rates, while <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/student-loans\">private student loans</a> often have higher rates. Private loans also don't come with the same benefits, so it can make sense to prioritize paying them off.</p><h3>4. Loan balances</h3><p>Review your balances to see how much you owe in student loans compared to how much you have invested. If your student loan balance is low, you might want to pay it off quickly and then focus on investing.</p><h3>5. Tax benefits</h3><p>You may want to take advantage of tax benefits by paying your student loans and investing in your 401(k). Depending on your income and eligibility, deducting up to $2,500 in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-interest-tax-deductible\">student loan interest</a>&nbsp;each year is possible. Putting money into your 401(k) lowers your taxable income, which can help you pay less in taxes (however, you're responsible for taxes upon withdrawal in retirement).</p><h3>6. Employer benefits</h3><p>Does your employer offer student loan repayment assistance and/or a 401(k) match? Take advantage of any student loan or retirement benefits. If one is worth more, that may influence where to focus.</p><h3>7. Age</h3><p>Your age affects your time horizon, or how long you must invest until you reach your goal. It's a very different situation if you're 25 compared to 45 or 55. If you're older and many years out of college, you generally can't afford not to invest.</p><h3>8. Forgiveness opportunities</h3><p>Federal student loan borrowers may be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/public-service-loan-forgiveness\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> (PSLF) or income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness. If you qualify and want to pursue <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/student-loan-forgiveness-programs\">student loan forgiveness</a>, it doesn't make sense to pay more than the minimum, since your goal is to get the loans discharged.</p><p>In this case, focus on investing while making the minimum payments on your student loans. If you're not going for forgiveness, you might consider <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/when-to-refinance\">student loan refinancing</a> — but weigh the advantages first, as you'll no longer qualify for federal loan benefits after you refinance.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:11694":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"11694","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"rich-cta","variation":"copy-only"},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:257538":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"257538","content":"<h3>9. Emotional well-being</h3><p>If your student loan debt is affecting your emotional well-being or causing undue stress, paying it off can pay greater dividends for you overall than investing.</p><h3>10. Risk tolerance</h3><p>When weighing investing vs. paying off debt, it's crucial to consider your risk tolerance. Paying off debt is a surefire way to lower your balance and pay less interest. On the other hand, investing always has some level of risk and is more of a gamble. Your risk tolerance is how much risk you feel comfortable investing. If you're extremely anxious about the market's volatility, that may influence your decision.</p><h2>Benefits of paying off student loans early</h2><p>Debt is costly, so there are major benefits to paying off student loans early, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Save money on interest: </strong>You could pay significantly less in interest charges over the life of your loan if you pay off student loans early.</li><li><strong>Improve cash flow: </strong>Monthly student loan payments may take up a substantial part of your budget. Paying off your student loans frees up that money each month, improving your cash flow. The funds can then go toward your emergency fund, investing, or other financial priorities.</li><li><strong>Lower debt-to-income ratio (DTI): </strong>Your debt-to-income ratio is the percentage of income you pay toward debt each month. While your DTI doesn't impact your credit score, it's a metric that lenders typically look at when you apply for a mortgage or new credit. Lowering your DTI may help your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Become student debt-free sooner: </strong>You can shave years off your repayment term by paying off student loans early, which means one less payment to worry about.</li><li><strong>Ease emotional burden: </strong>When you pay off debt, you might feel lighter and less stressed because you don't have the obligation hanging over your head.</li></ul><h2>Drawbacks of paying off student loans early</h2><p>Paying off your student loans early also comes with cons, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Lose out on loan forgiveness:</strong> If you have federal student loans and repay them before the end of your repayment term, you’ll pay the full amount, rather than having the remainder of your loan forgiven. It likely doesn’t make sense to pay off your loans early when you’re working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness or another forgiveness program.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Can miss out on higher returns:</strong>&nbsp;If you focus on paying off your loans before investing, you may lose out on potentially higher investment returns.</li><li><strong>No student loan interest deduction:</strong> This tax benefit allows you to deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest for the year. Paying off your loans means you lose the opportunity to use this deduction, which could be worthwhile for some taxpayers.</li></ul><h3>Early student loan payoff example</h3><p>To take a closer look at interest savings, let's say you have a student loan balance of $30,000 with a 6.80% interest rate and a 10-year loan term. Your monthly payment is $345 per month. If you decide to put an additional $100 toward your debt each month, you'll save $3,531 in interest.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:257542":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"257542","content":"<h3>Consider the tax deductions for student loan interest</h3><p>Depending on your tax situation, you might qualify for a student loan interest deduction to help you prioritize your financial goals.</p><p>The IRS lets student loan borrowers deduct up to $2,500 in annual interest paid for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $85,000 or less, or $170,000 or less for joint filers.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:257550":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"257550","content":"<h2>Benefits of investing before paying off loans</h2><p>Depending on the size of your student loan debt, it can take many years to pay it all off. If you don't invest during that time, you could miss out on precious time and the power of compounding. Some benefits of investing before you pay off student loans include:</p><ul><li><strong>More time to compound: </strong>The longer you have money invested, the more time you have for the power of compound interest (interest earned on the money you've saved) to do its magic. That can accelerate your growth and build wealth.</li><li><strong>Attractive returns: </strong>You may get a higher rate of return investing instead of paying off debt. The stock market has typically provided annual returns of 10%, or 6% to 7% when accounting for inflation, according to the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).</li><li><strong>Get an employer match: </strong>If you invest in your retirement and secure an employer match before paying off student loans, that's free future money you get as part of your compensation package. Note that it's typically best to contribute to your retirement fund at the same time as you pay off student loans, even if you can only contribute a small amount to a 401(k).</li><li><strong>Build a nest egg faster: </strong>Investing now before paying off your student loans means building your nest egg faster. That can mean more financial security and the potential for retiring early or more retirement possibilities.</li><li><strong>Potential withdrawal: </strong>If you invest money in a Roth IRA, you have some flexibility with the funds and can withdraw your initial contributions early (not earnings) without any penalty or tax consequences. For other retirement vehicles, you pay an early withdrawal tax of 10%, but there are exceptions, according to the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions\">IRS</a>. These include adopting a child, disability, or emergency personal expenses. While it's best to avoid tapping retirement funds, in some situations, the money can help you in a bind<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><h2>Drawbacks of investing before paying off loans</h2><p>While investing can potentially offer attractive returns, prioritizing investing may not make sense in some situations. Drawbacks to this approach include:</p><ul><li><strong>Stay in debt longer:</strong> Continuing to make payments on your student loans as normal means you’ll remain in debt longer. This means you won’t improve your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and you’ll still have a loan hanging over your head.</li><li><strong>Might lose money:</strong>&nbsp;Investing doesn’t automatically guarantee that you’ll make more money. You could actually lose money on your investments.</li><li><strong>Less flexibility in your budget:</strong>&nbsp;By keeping your student loans and putting money toward investing, you may not have much room in your budget for other financial goals.</li></ul><h3>Investing example</h3><p>To show the power of time in the market and compound interest, let's look at an example. Imagine you're starting at $0 invested today. But you decide to contribute $100 per month to investments instead of extra student loan payments.</p><p>With an interest rate return of 7.00%, you can see the major differences in the projected investment total based on the length of time. In 10 years, you're projected to have over $16,000. At 20 years, the time is now doubled, but your projected investment total nearly triples. At 30 years, you exceed six figures in investments, according to <a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">Investor.gov</a>.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:257546":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"257546","content":"<h2>Balancing both: Paying off student loans and investing simultaneously</h2><p>When considering student loan payoff strategies, you might feel like going all in and neglecting investing. But there's no rule saying that you can't balance both paying off student loans and investing at the same time. Doing so can save you money in interest and help you build wealth, so when you're finally free of debt, you have some assets to your name.</p><p>Let's look at how, using the same numbers as above. Instead of putting $100 to pay off student loans or invest, let's say you split that and put $50 toward your student loans and $50 toward your investments.</p><h3>Paying off student loans and investing example</h3><p>If you have a $30,000 loan balance at 6.80% with a 10-year loan term, paying $50 more on your student loans saves you $2,096 in interest.

Emergency home or car repairs</h2><p>Some emergencies need to be addressed right away to prevent further damage to your property and pocketbook — like if a pipe bursts in your home, or you run into trouble with your car’s engine.</p><p>You could take out an <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-emergency-loans\">emergency personal loan</a> and possibly get funding as soon as the same or next business day after approval. If you need around $500 or less, consider a cash advance app — just check express funding fees. This is where these apps can get expensive.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Emergency vet expenses</h2><p>An unexpected vet bill for your animal companion can be pricey. An emergency vet visit could cost up to $3,000 for a cat and up to $5,000 for a dog, according to pet insurance provider <a href=\"https://www.metlifepetinsurance.com/blog/pet-health/emergency-vet-cost/\">MetLife</a>. If you can’t pay for this expense out of pocket or your pet insurance doesn’t cover it, you may look into a <a href=\"/personal-loan/pet-loans\">pet loan</a>. If you're struggling to cover any upfront costs, such as for the office visit (aside from emergency pet surgery, etc.), consider a cash advance app for near-instant money.&nbsp;</p><p>For a loan large enough to cover the bulk of your pet's vet bills, look to a <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan</a>. You can spread costs out over several years to keep them affordable, if necessary, and rates are much lower than credit card annual percentage rates (APRs), on average. Some lenders can send money the same day you apply, and some even offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/pet-loans\">pet loans for bad credit</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Life events</h2><p>If you experience a life event like <a href=\"/personal-loan/loans-for-unemployed\">losing your job</a>, you may consider taking out an emergency loan to cover your bills until you find another one. Or, you may need to borrow money to pay bills if you’re <a href=\"/personal-loan/self-employed-loans\">self-employed</a> and your income suffers a major drop.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be more difficult to <a href=\"/personal-loan/low-income-loan\">qualify for a low income loan</a>. But applying with a <a href=\"/personal-loan/coapplicant-vs-cosigner\">cosigner or a co-borrower</a>, or securing the loan with collateral, could help.

Debt consolidation</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">Debt consolidation</a> involves combining your debt into a new loan, such as a personal loan, with a single monthly payment. You can use consolidation to make repaying debt more manageable or lower your overall interest rate.</p><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-does-debt-consolidation-work\">Consolidating your debt</a> might not be a typical emergency — unless you've realized you can't continue to afford your current debt payments or will have to make some big sacrifices to do so.

Large essential purchases</h2><p>An emergency loan can also help you cover large and expensive repairs. For example, you may need to take out one if your refrigerator or washing machine breaks down and it’s beyond repair.</p><h2>Types of emergency loans</h2><p>Several types of emergency loans exist, including:</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p>A personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan you can get from a bank, credit union, or online lender. They are usually unsecured, meaning you don’t have to pledge collateral to qualify. <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-much-of-a-personal-loan-can-i-get\">Loan amounts</a> can range from $600 to $100,000 or more, depending on the lender, with typical <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">repayment terms</a> of 1 to 7 years. Personal loans might also have <a href=\"/personal-loan/origination-fee\">origination fees</a> from 1% to 12%. You can <a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-personal-loans-used-for\">use a personal loan</a> for a variety of reasons, including debt consolidation and emergency purchases.</p><h3>Cash advance apps</h3><p>Cash advance apps generally allow you to borrow a small sum of money to tide you over until your next payday. A major benefit of this option is that these generally don't require a credit check. But, while many of these apps don’t charge traditional interest, other fees like subscription fees, fast funding fees, and optional tips can quickly increase your cost to borrow.</p><p>You can usually borrow anywhere from less than $100 to $500 (or possibly more, depending on the app). Payment is typically due by your next paycheck.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.earnin.com/\">EarnIn</a>, <a href=\"https://dave.com/extra-cash-advances\">Dave</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.moneylion.com/cash-advance/instacash\">MoneyLion</a> are some apps to consider for a cash advance.</p><p><strong>Check Out: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/500-loan\">5 Types of $500 Loans and How to Get One</a></p><h3>Car title loans</h3><p>A car title loan is a small loan that is secured by your vehicle. These also may have triple-digit APRs, and if you don’t repay the loan on time, the lender can repossess your car. You typically need to own the vehicle before you can use it as collateral for the loan, and are generally limited to borrowing 25% to 50% of your car’s value.</p><h3>Payday loans</h3><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">Payday loans</a> are small, short-term loans that don’t require a credit check. But the trade-off is that they have significant fees, which translate into triple-digit APRs. Most payday loans charge fees from $10 to $30 for every $100 that you borrow. These loans are also limited in how much you can borrow, usually up to $500, and must be repaid by your next paycheck, which is usually 2 to 4 weeks. If you're considering a payday loan, use a <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/payday-loan\">payday loan calculator</a> to see the true cost of the loan.</p><h3>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</h3><p>Some federal credit unions (FCUs) offer <a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\">payday alternative loans</a> to help consumers avoid taking out payday loans. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) caps the APRs of payday alternative loans at 28%.</p><p>The NCUA allows FCUs to offer two types of PALs: PALs I and PALs II. The NCUA doesn’t allow an FCU to issue more than one type of PAL to a single applicant at one time, however.</p><p>Here’s a table that breaks down some key differences between both PAL options.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:233002":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"233002","content":"<h2>How to borrow money for emergencies</h2><p>Here are the steps you can take to apply for a personal loan for emergencies.</p><ol><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\"><strong>Prequalify</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Many lenders, especially online lenders, allow you to prequalify for a personal loan <a href=\"/personal-loan/does-applying-for-a-loan-hurt-credit\">without harming your credit</a>.

Some tactics you might try include:</p><ol><li><strong>Refinance: </strong>Refinancing involves taking out a new loan to pay off your existing student loans. It can potentially lower your interest rate or extend the repayment term to make your monthly payments more affordable.</li><li><strong>Making extra principal payments:</strong> Making extra principal payments helps you pay off the loans faster and saves you interest in the long run.</li><li><strong>Income-driven repayment plans: </strong>Federal income-driven repayment (IDR) plans adjust your monthly payments based on your income and family size. They also forgive any remaining balance after 20 or 25 years.</li><li><strong>Creating a budget that prioritizes your student loans: </strong>You can accelerate progress toward student loan repayment by building a budget that allocates a significant portion of your income to your loans.</li></ol><p>Here are four of the best strategies to help you tackle your student loan debt and potentially save thousands of dollars in interest.</p><h2>1. See if refinancing makes sense</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans\">Refinancing your student loans</a> can be a smart strategy — especially if you qualify for a lower interest rate. Refinancing may allow you to <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-interest-rate\">secure a lower interest rate</a> if your credit score has improved since you initially took out your loans. This can save you thousands over the life of the loan.</p><p>For example, say you have $140,000 in student loans with an interest rate of 6.8%, a monthly payment of $1,737, and nine years of payments left. If you could refinance into a new 10-year loan with a 4.25% interest rate, your monthly payment would drop to $1,434, and you'd save $15,472 in interest over the next decade.</p><p>While the savings can be substantial, keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/refinance-federal-student-loans\">refinancing federal student loans</a> with a private lender means losing access to federal loan benefits, like income-driven repayment plans, deferment, forbearance, and student loan forgiveness programs.</p><p>To find out <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/should-I-refinance\">if refinancing is right for you</a>, you can prequalify with multiple lenders to compare rates and terms without affecting your credit score, as it only involves a soft credit check.</p>"},"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType:9082":{"__typename":"strapiPartnersWidgetsBlockType","id":"9082","environment":"production","omitUtmParams":false,"uniqueId":null,"widgetAnalyticsOptions":null,"widgetInitialValuesOptions":null,"widgetProductOptions":{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductOptions","otherOptions":null,"marketplace":[{"__typename":"strapiWidgetProductMarketplace","vertical":"student-loan-refi"}],"type":"loan-score-calculator","variation":null},"widgetUiOptions":null},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:232438":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"232438","content":"<h2>2. Make extra payments to reduce interest costs</h2><p>Making extra payments on your student loans is one of the most effective strategies for lowering interest costs and speeding up repayment. Even small additional payments each month can add up over time and reduce the total interest you'll pay.</p><p>For example, say you have $140,000 in student loans with an interest rate of 6.8% and a 10-year repayment term. If you just paid the minimum each month, you'd pay $53,335 in interest. However, if you paid an extra $100 toward the loan principal each month, you'd pay $48,637 in interest — saving $4,698 in interest and shaving nine months off your repayment term.</p><p>When you make extra payments, ensure your loan servicer applies them directly to the principal balance instead of future interest. Also, prioritize loans with the highest interest rates to get the most savings. You may need to contact your servicer for guidance on directing extra payments toward the principal.</p><h2>3. Consider an income-driven repayment plan</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-driven-repayment-plan\">Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans</a> adjust your monthly federal student loan payments based on your income and family size, making them more manageable if you're dealing with a large balance like $100k.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education offers four IDR plans to choose from:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-based-repayment\">Income-Based Repayment (IBR)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/save-repayment-plan\">Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/income-contingent-repayment\">Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/pay-as-you-earn\">Pay As You Earn (PAYE)</a></li></ul><p>While IDR plans can <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/lower-monthly-student-loan-payment\">lower your monthly payments</a>, they typically extend your repayment period by 25 years. This means you'll likely pay more interest over time, which could take decades to pay off your loans. However, any remaining balance is forgiven at the end of the repayment term, which can be a major advantage if your income remains low or stagnant.</p><p>Before enrolling, consider your long-term financial goals. If you can afford larger payments, paying off your loans more quickly may save you money in interest. But if your current budget is tight, IDR can provide immediate relief and prevent default. Just be mindful of the potential trade-offs in terms of overall cost.</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:232442":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"232442","content":"<h2>4.

The lender will also order an appraisal to gauge the home’s value (and make sure it’s worth the money you’re requesting to borrow for it).</li><li><strong>Get ready for closing: </strong>Once your loan is nearing full approval, you’ll get a closing date, which is when you’ll sign the final paperwork and receive your keys.

Personal loans, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-home-equity-loan\">home equity loans</a>, and credit card balance transfers are some options for debt consolidation.

The main difference lies in who has a right to the proceeds:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-with-cosigner\"><strong>Cosigned loans</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A cosigner is someone who agrees to use their credit profile to help you improve your chances of getting a loan. The cosigner promises that if you are unable to repay the loan, the lender can seek payment from the cosigner. The cosigner does not have the right to use the loan funds. But any late payments you make could reflect poorly on the cosigner’s credit, since the account will become part of their credit report.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/best-joint-personal-loan \"><strong>Joint loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Both borrowers’ credit profiles are considered during the application process, and each co-borrower has an equal right to the loan money and is equally responsible for repayment.</li></ul><p>Joint loans are typically a good fit for spouses or those in domestic partnerships who want to take out a loan to use on a joint asset, such as a home improvement loan.

For example, many online retailers allow you to use BNPL to purchase electronics, clothing, furniture, etc. They typically run a soft credit check to see if you qualify — this means it won’t impact your credit, but bad-credit borrowers may struggle to get approved for BNPL financing.</p><p>Depending on the company, BNPL plans may split up repayment into four biweekly payments with no interest charges. You may have to pay the first installment when you make the purchase.</p><p>Buy now, pay later loans may be a good fit if you can confidently pay off purchases over a six-week time frame. However, many BNPL lenders provide options to extend payments for up to a year or longer — but these options typically carry APRs up to 36%.</p><h2>Bad-credit loans</h2><p>Aside from secured loans or using a cosigner, there are personal loans available for those with <a href=\"/personal-loan/bad-credit-loans\">bad credit</a>, including:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/payday-alternative-loan\"><strong>Payday alternative loans (PALs)</strong></a><strong>: </strong>PALs are small loans for credit union members up to $2,000. They’re designed for borrowers who might struggle to get approved for a regular personal loan. APRs are capped at 28%, and repayment terms range up to 12 months.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\"><strong>Payday loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These are very short-term, high-fee loans, usually available up to $500 with no credit check. The amount you borrow is typically due when you receive your next paycheck. In some states, <a href=\"https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2022/04/payday-loans-cost-4-times-more-in-states-with-few-consumer-protections\">payday loan APRs</a> can be over 500%, which can make repayment challenging and lead to a destructive cycle of expensive debt.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/pawn-shop-loans\"><strong>Pawnshop loans</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Some pawnshops make loans if you offer personal property as collateral, like jewelry, tools, or a musical instrument. The item is stored at the shop until the borrower has repaid the loan or when the pawn contract has expired without repayment. In that case, the pawnshop has the right to sell the personal property. Pawnshop contracts may expire in as little as one month — if you’re not sure you can pay the loan back, don’t secure it with something you can’t afford to lose.</li><li><strong>Cash advance apps:</strong> Like payday loans, cash advance apps usually require repayment by your next paycheck. There’s no credit check, and loan amounts are generally limited to $500 or $1,000, depending on the app and your income. With some apps, like Earnin and MoneyLion, fees are optional — like for tipping or expedited payments. But these fees can add up to triple-digit APRs.</li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/no-credit-check-loans\"><strong>No-credit-check personal loans</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some <a href=\"/personal-loan\">personal loan lenders</a> offer loans with only a soft credit inquiry or no credit check during the application process. It’s crucial to shop for these loans, as APRs could be around 150%, which is lower than many payday loan APRs, but still considered predatory. <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-term-length\">Repayment terms</a> may last from less than a year to 5 years, depending on the lender.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Choosing the right personal loan</h2><p>Choosing the right personal loan depends on your financial situation and goals. For instance, if you want to borrow money in order to upgrade your home, an unsecured personal loan may be a good choice, as large loan amounts are available, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/same-day-loans\">approval can be quick</a> (if you have <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-personal-loans-for-good-credit\">good credit</a>). On the other hand, if you only need a <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-small-loan\">small amount</a> to make purchases for the holiday season, a BNPL loan may be a better choice.</p><p>Before applying for a loan, take the time to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-compare-personal-loans\">compare different lenders</a>, including APRs, loan terms, and fees. The APR accounts for both the loan’s interest rate and upfront fees, and is the great equalizer when it comes to comparing loans that charge fees instead of interest (this is common with no-credit-check loans like payday loans and cash advance apps).</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:230982":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"230982","content":"<p><i><strong>Read More:</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-do-personal-loans-work\"><i>How Do Personal Loans Work?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/should-i-get-a-personal-loan\"><i>Should I Get a Personal Loan?</i></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/how-to-get-a-low-interest-loan\"><i>How To Get a Low-Interest Loan</i></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-vs-0-apr-credit-card\"><i>Personal Loan vs. 0% APR Credit Card</i></a></li></ul><p><i><strong>Disclosure: </strong>Some lending partners that participate in Credible’s comparison marketplace offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 550.

Instead, you sign the loan agreement and promise to repay the amount borrowed, plus interest. <a href=\"/personal-loan\">Personal loans</a> are typically unsecured.

Use this opportunity to <a href=\"/personal-finance/how-to-build-credit\">improve your credit</a> over the next few months by paying off debt, making on-time payments, and disputing errors.</li><li><strong>Get a loan without low interest:</strong> Depending on <a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-score-for-personal-loan\">your credit score</a>, you could still qualify for a loan with a moderate APR.

Just note that reducing the amount you owe on your credit cards could have a more positive impact on your credit score (and budget) than paying off an installment loan early.</p><h3>Budgeting</h3><p>Making a budget can help you allocate more of your income toward debt repayment, so you can make progress faster and minimize the amount you pay in interest. It can also help you save money and break free from a cycle of debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Having <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">money set aside for emergencies</a> makes it less likely you’ll need to turn to credit cards and other types of debt to pay for unexpected expenses. There are many popular budgeting apps and tools available, but if you prefer a more traditional paper budget or spreadsheet, these are also an option.</p><h3>Debt snowball or avalanche method</h3><p>Two of the best strategies for paying off debt are the debt snowball and avalanche methods. The debt snowball method involves prioritizing paying off your smallest debt first, while making all other minimum payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the smallest balance has been paid off, add the amount you were putting toward it to the minimum payment on the next-smallest balance, and so on. By prioritizing the smaller balances first, you’ll likely see progress faster, which can help boost motivation.</p><p>The debt avalanche method works similarly, but involves first focusing your attention on the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the avalanche method can help reduce the total amount of interest you pay on your debts, but it may take longer to see initial results.</p><h3>Loan refinancing</h3><p>Sometimes, you may want to replace a high-interest loan with a lower-interest one, instead of paying it off entirely. This is common, for example, with mortgages and personal loans.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, you'd <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-apply-for-personal-loan\">apply for a new loan</a> and use it to pay off the old one, thereby reducing your interest rate and monthly payments. The application for new credit and the closing of the old loan could initially lower your score, but as you develop a positive payment history on the new loan, it should improve.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learn More: </strong><a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-refinance-a-personal-loan\">How To Refinance a Personal Loan</a></p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:229462":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"229462","content":"<p><strong>Related Articles:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans\">Best Debt Consolidation Loans</a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/what-is-debt-consolidation\">What Is Debt Consolidation?</a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/debt-consolidation-loans/how-does-debt-consolidation-work\">How Does Debt Consolidation Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/ways-to-consolidate-credit-card-debt\">Ways To Consolidate Credit Card Debt</a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/how-to-pay-off-10k-in-credit-card-debt\">How To Pay Off $10K in Credit Card Debt</a></li><li><a href=\"/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loans/30000-credit-card-debt\">How To Pay Off $20K in Credit Card Debt</a></li></ul>"},"strapiMarketingBanner:2":{"__typename":"strapiMarketingBanner","id":"2","slug":"financial-tools","title":"Get your financial goals on track","titleColor":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"neutral700"},"description":"Free credit score, automatic debt tracking, and goal setting all in one place.","descriptionColor":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary700"},"bgColors":[{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"green100"},{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary300"}],"cta":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedCta","text":"Get Started","href":"/login?redirectTo=%2Fhub%2Ffinancial-tools","variant":"contained","size":"small","leftIcon":null,"rightIcon":null,"color":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedColor","name":"secondary500"}},"image":{"__typename":"strapiImageType","url":"https://cdn.credible.com/content-images/95cb9c03-4b52-48e6-96e0-20999155becb","alternativeText":null}},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:228378":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"228378","content":"<p>Building a positive credit background requires time, consistency, and financial discipline, but the payoff can be significant.

With this strategy, you'd ask someone you're close to — like a parent, sibling, or spouse — to add your name as an authorized user on their card.

Consider these questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Do you have other income or assets?</strong> Consider whether you have or can set up other sources of income to pay the bills. For instance, you could pursue a side hustle to earn extra cash, such as driving for Uber or renting out storage space in your home.

Take note of any take-home pay, as well, such as severance pay, unemployment benefits, or a spouse’s income.</p><p>As you review your income and expenses, find the areas where you can cut back — the cuts don’t have to be permanent, but can help keep you afloat until you find your next job. For instance, eliminating a subscription service or two may allow you to funnel that money toward credit card bills and avoid late fees.</p><h2>3. Make minimum payments while unemployed</h2><p>If you expect your financial situation to improve, make the minimum payments on your credit cards for as long as you can. By keeping up with those payments, you’ll avoid late fees and penalty APRs.</p><p>Plus, your accounts will remain in good standing, and your credit card issuers won’t have missed payments to report to the credit bureaus.

Research lenders and loan options</h2><p>Before applying for a personal loan, make sure to thoroughly research your loan options. There are many <a href=\"/personal-loan\">highly rated personal loan lenders</a>, and it’s important to find one that best meets your needs.</p><p>When choosing a lender, there are generally <a href=\"/personal-loan/where-can-i-get-a-personal-loan\">three types to choose from</a>: <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-banks-for-personal-loans\">traditional banks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/credit-union-loans\">credit unions</a>, and <a href=\"/personal-loan/best-online-loans\">online lenders</a>. Each of these options has its own pros and cons. A traditional bank or credit union could be a good option if you already have a relationship with that financial institution, such as having your accounts there or having previously borrowed from them.</p><p>Online lenders also have some major advantages. Because they don’t have physical locations, their overhead tends to be lower, which can result in lower fees and interest rates for borrowers. Additionally, some have more lenient eligibility requirements and offer loans to borrowers with poor or fair credit.</p><p>It’s helpful to decide ahead of time what you need when it comes to your loan amount and repayment term, as well as your credit score and your desired APR. Knowing these factors upfront can help you narrow down your lender options quickly.</p><h2>4. Prequalify with multiple lenders</h2><p>Many lenders allow you to <a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-pre-approval\">prequalify for a personal loan</a>, meaning you’ll go through a soft credit check to determine whether you’re likely to qualify for a loan and what your estimated APR, amounts, and terms are.&nbsp;</p><p>Because prequalification doesn’t negatively affect your credit score, it presents an opportunity to shop around with different lenders to see which could offer the best option for you.

While expensive, doing so could boost your property value and earn you more money when you eventually sell your home.</p><h4>A caveat regarding personal loans for home improvement</h4><p>Personal loans aren’t your only option for home improvement. What makes them most appealing is the fast funding, but those interest rates can cost you in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>Chad Gammon, Certified Financial Planner and owner at Custom Fit Financial, always asks his clients to consider two alternatives —&nbsp;<a href=\"/mortgage/home-equity-loan-vs-line-credit\">home equity loans and home equity lines of credit</a> (HELOC) — which take longer to fund but offer better rates.</p><p>“HELOCs have a [lower] variable rate that’s better than a personal loan, and they’re good for flexibility,” such as ongoing home improvements over time, Gammon says. And a home equity loan “is good for a larger, single renovation” and “typically has the lowest interest rate” of all three options (home equity loan, HELOC, and personal loan).&nbsp;</p>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:200722":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"200722","content":"<h3>When you can’t cover unexpected expenses on your own</h3><p>If you’ve explored all the logical options to pay what you owe — and still can’t come up with the money — you may have no other choice than to <a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-get-personal-loan\">take out a personal loan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While a personal loan can be expensive, depending on your credit, they’re a far safer and more affordable option than predatory&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/what-are-payday-loans\">payday loans</a>. And they&nbsp;offer longer repayment terms than other quick cash options like cash advance apps, <a href=\"/personal-loan/buy-now-pay-later\">BNPL loans</a>, and credit cards.</p><h3>When you’re in an unhealthy environment</h3><p>Finally, you might need to consider a personal loan if you’re in a place that is physically or emotionally unsafe and you need money to get out.</p><p>“A personal loan could be a viable option for someone living in an unhealthy environment who needs financial support to relocate to a safer place,” says Gomez. This could include leaving an abusive relationship or moving out of an apartment in an unsafe area or that has unsafe living conditions your landlord refuses to address.</p><h2>When is a personal loan not a smart idea?</h2><p>A personal loan isn’t always the right choice. Don’t take out a personal loan if:</p><ul><li>You have time to come up with the cash.</li><li>You don’t need the money.</li><li>You’re on a tight budget and won’t comfortably be able to afford the monthly payment.</li><li>You haven’t yet explored other options.</li></ul><p>Here are some scenarios when a personal loan doesn’t make sense:</p><h3>When you could pay off the bill in under a month</h3><p>If you don’t have the cash on hand to tackle a big expense but you will by your next pay day, you may not need to take out a personal loan.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming the proprietor accepts credit card payments (and you have a credit card with a high enough limit), you could instead pay the bill with your credit card and take advantage of 0% interest during the card’s grace period.</p><p>Just make sure you pay off the credit card as soon as your paycheck hits, or else you’ll carry that balance over to the next month and could pay exorbitant interest on it.</p><h3>When the expense isn’t necessary</h3><p>If you don’t&nbsp;<i>have</i> to take out a personal loan, don’t. That means you generally shouldn’t take out a loan to buy Christmas presents, pay for a wedding, or fund a vacation.</p><p>Instead, focus on saving up for these discretionary expenses. Each month, deposit the money you would otherwise be spending on monthly loan payments into a&nbsp;high-yield savings account or CD with a maturity date that corresponds to when you need the funds.</p><h3>You can get better financing options elsewhere</h3><p>This may seem obvious, but it’s worth repeating. You should only consider a personal loan if you’ve exhausted other, often&nbsp; better options:</p><ul><li><strong>Emergency fund:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re facing an emergency and have&nbsp;<a href=\"/personal-loan/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\">emergency savings</a>, use it — that’s what it’s there for. Even if you have savings earmarked for something else, like a vacation or down payment on a house, you should spend it on emergency expenses rather than take on new debt. But you may want to think twice before completely depleting your emergency fund.</li><li><strong>Family loans:</strong>&nbsp;Borrowing from friends and family can be a touchy subject, and for many, it’s a non-starter. But if you are in a tough spot and believe a loved one would be willing to help, it’s worth asking. Just make sure you prioritize repaying them promptly, and if they say no, thank them for their time and move on to another option.</li><li><strong>Payment plan:</strong>&nbsp;Some expenses, like furniture and appliances, may cost more than you have in your savings, but you may not need a personal loan to purchase them. Often, stores offer 0% financing; as long as you pay off the item before the end of the promotional period, you won’t pay any interest. Similarly, doctors and hospitals are often willing to work out a payment plan for high medical bills.&nbsp;</li></ul>"},"strapiComponentSharedTextContent:200726":{"__typename":"strapiComponentSharedTextContent","id":"200726","content":"<h2>Personal loan interest rates</h2><p><a href=\"/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates\">Personal loan interest rates</a> depend on several factors, including current market conditions, your credit history, and the lender you choose.

And a home equity loan “is good for a larger, single renovation” and “typically has the lowest interest rate” of all three options (home equity loan, HELOC, and personal loan). </p></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_pin__z_PTM"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAgCAYAAAAbifjMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAD9SURBVHgB7ZQxTsMwFIb/P6YREksFF4jKRDZuULaOXTOVlgMgTgBchFbKCZhgI9ygA3SEHADRzFC/hz2UoaVScDvmW2w/+f/kwe8BW8L5qHOt4A3+T0mxp1Fg2JPYyPQjt6kQiFE73xPBMCIuFxaJCJM6wbilhZLPh+PynsvirHcyATmoI0gfZr+5CFvSCBrBTgT8uDjuUzGw3+yKsl0nFLfE9YJOj+7ervg56rw7T4IABK4RQ8NL/EC5RQiqUyO24Gr9pZeeu/kwXg+wSB9fz9ZesFoQagVFuYj3q6+DNvzqz/D1PyA2kOd51xjzRHKSZdlw073mKzeCnQh+AIFqUAFq25YWAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="pin Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_pinImg__6k6q1"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_pinTitle__dnoCL styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Note</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">If you don’t have sufficient home equity (typically, 15% to 20%), you may not qualify for a home equity loan or HELOC.</p></div><section class="BodyContent_bodyContent__Dn38S"><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">When you can’t cover unexpected expenses on your own</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">If you’ve explored all the logical options to pay what you owe — and still can’t come up with the money — you may have no other choice than to <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="how-to-get-personal-loan.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">take out a personal loan</a>. </p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">While a personal loan can be expensive, depending on your credit, they’re a far safer and more affordable option than predatory <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="what-are-payday-loans.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">payday loans</a>.

That means you generally shouldn’t take out a loan to buy Christmas presents, pay for a wedding, or fund a vacation.</p><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">Instead, focus on saving up for these discretionary expenses. Each month, deposit the money you would otherwise be spending on monthly loan payments into a high-yield savings account or CD with a maturity date that corresponds to when you need the funds.</p><h3 class="mb-16 styles_heading__zd9LO styles_bold__faN_F">You can get better financing options elsewhere</h3><p class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR">This may seem obvious, but it’s worth repeating. You should only consider a personal loan if you’ve exhausted other, often  better options:</p><ul class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Emergency fund:</strong> If you’re facing an emergency and have <a class=" styles_solid__hpxG9 styles_link__iyknm styles_inherit__ZOOFu styles_secondary__pApUQ" href="how-to-start-an-emergency-fund.html" rel="" target="_self" tabindex="0">emergency savings</a>, use it — that’s what it’s there for.

But if you are in a tough spot and believe a loved one would be willing to help, it’s worth asking. Just make sure you prioritize repaying them promptly, and if they say no, thank them for their time and move on to another option.</li><li class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR"><strong class="mb-16 styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Payment plan:</strong> Some expenses, like furniture and appliances, may cost more than you have in your savings, but you may not need a personal loan to purchase them. Often, stores offer 0% financing; as long as you pay off the item before the end of the promotional period, you won’t pay any interest. Similarly, doctors and hospitals are often willing to work out a payment plan for high medical bills. </li></ul></section><div class="styles_calloutBox__vk_Zd mb-24"><div class="styles_vDivider__qiSTP styles_pin__z_PTM"></div><div class="styles_titleSection__7W66a"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAgCAYAAAAbifjMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAD9SURBVHgB7ZQxTsMwFIb/P6YREksFF4jKRDZuULaOXTOVlgMgTgBchFbKCZhgI9ygA3SEHADRzFC/hz2UoaVScDvmW2w/+f/kwe8BW8L5qHOt4A3+T0mxp1Fg2JPYyPQjt6kQiFE73xPBMCIuFxaJCJM6wbilhZLPh+PynsvirHcyATmoI0gfZr+5CFvSCBrBTgT8uDjuUzGw3+yKsl0nFLfE9YJOj+7ervg56rw7T4IABK4RQ8NL/EC5RQiqUyO24Gr9pZeeu/kwXg+wSB9fz9ZesFoQagVFuYj3q6+DNvzqz/D1PyA2kOd51xjzRHKSZdlw073mKzeCnQh+AIFqUAFq25YWAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="pin Icon" class="styles_icon__49lp2 styles_pinImg__6k6q1"/><p class="styles_title__Al6SH styles_pinTitle__dnoCL styles_body__wG6cR styles_bold__faN_F">Warning</p></div><p class="mt-8 styles_body__wG6cR">0% financing offers often charge deferred interest.

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

You can also choose between bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly payment schedules.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's a good choice for debt consolidation and credit card refinancing, but borrowers with excellent credit may not find the lowest rates with Reach. The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

Loans are available up to $35,000 and you could get the money as soon as the next business day after approval. Plus, Avant is more likely than some lenders to approve the applications of borrowers who've prequalified with Avant. However, the lender charges an origination fee up to 9.99%, and its top-range interest rates are among the highest of the lenders we reviewed.</p></div></div><div

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

There is no minimum credit score required (if you apply directly with OneMain), which means you could get a loan with bad credit (FICO below 580). Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

This could make the lender a good choice if you have at least fair credit and have struggled to qualify with other lenders. It also offers loans as low as $1,000 and as large as $75,000, making it an appealing option for a wide range of loan needs. Upstart may charge an origination fee as high as 15%, but good-credit borrowers may not be charged one at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trustpilot gives Upstart 4.9 stars, which is the highest of all lenders we reviewed. However, it received a below average score in J.D.

It offers competitive rates, reasonable loan terms and amounts, and personal loans for fair credit. You'll need a FICO score of at least 600 to qualify, which means borrowers with fair credit are eligible. Plus, Best Egg is one of a handful of Credible partner lenders to offer secured loans, and the only one we know of that offers loans secured by the fixtures in your home. This can be a great way for homeowners to lower their rate, while not putting their actual home up as collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Best Egg loans may have an origination fee, which ranges from 0.99% to 9.99% of the loan amount.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

It's an option for fair-credit borrowers (plus those with better credit), and notably has a relatively low top-end APR. In other words, you could qualify for a lower rate with Happy Money with fair credit, relative to other lenders that offer fair-credit loans. The company does charge an origination fee on some loans, up to 5%, but that's not as high as some other lenders' origination fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be prepared to wait a few days to get your money, as funding can take 3 to 6 business days once approved. And loans aren't available in Massachusetts, Iowa, or Nevada. Happy Money has an A+ rating with the BBB and is ideal for debt consolidation and credit card consolidation loans.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div

The company also charges more fees than some of its competitors and doesn't offer direct pay or autopay discounts. If you need a 7-year term loan, you'll need to look elsewhere.

APRs and available loan amounts are competitive — Rocket Loans offers loans up to $45,000. Plus, the company offers small business loans if you apply directly through its website. Notably, Rocket Loans delivered lower average rates than many competitors to borrowers with very good and excellent credit (based on closed loans data from the Credible marketplace over the last 12 months).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you'll only have a choice between two repayment terms — 3 or 5 years — and origination fees can be as high as 9.99%. You may qualify with fair credit, but Rocket Loans doesn't offer cosigned or secured options that could help you qualify or lower your rate.</p></div></div><div

Simply put, if you need an unsecured personal loan over $100,000, there are very few places to look, but BHG is one. You could have up to 10 years to repay the loan, but you'll need an annual income of at least $100,000 to qualify and a FICO score that's 660 or higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, you're unlikely to get a small loan (less than $20,000) through BHG — minimums vary by state. And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process. Funds must be used for debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

But unlike other lenders, SoFi doesn't specify a credit score minimum. It also has optional origination fees — you might elect to pay one to reduce your interest rate. Minimum loan amounts start at $5,000.</p></div></div><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_otherDetails__EUZom"><div class="LenderTableMoreDetails_column__EGaCs"><div><p

No-fee means no origination fees and no late fees, and Citi is one of few lenders that don’t charge either. (Origination fees are deducted from the loan upfront, reducing the amount you receive).&nbsp;</p><p>The company also offers a generous 0.50 percentage point autopay discount (the lowest rate includes the autopay discount) and makes same day funding available to most current Citi customers.&nbsp;However, Citi requires a relatively high credit score to qualify and caps the amount you can borrow at $30,000, which is less than most of its competitors.</p><p>Citi came in second for overall customer satisfaction in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-consumer-lending-satisfaction-study">J.D.

Not only does it offer bad credit loans, but the lender delivered the lowest rates, on average, to borrowers with bad credit compared to other Credible partners offering loans for bad credit. (Average interest rates are based on Credible personal loans data across credit score tiers over the last 12 months.) The lender also offers secured loans as well as some cosigned loans to help you qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprise loans are a great options for emergencies as loan funds can be available the next business day once you’re approved.

Plus, cosigners are allowed — a cosigner is someone (ideally, with good credit) who promises to repay the loan if you can't, which can make it easier to qualify or lower your rate. And, secured personal loans are available. You secure a loan with collateral, which may also help you qualify or lower your rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are higher than competitors and OneMain charges origination fees as either a flat fee up to $500, or a percentage from 1% to 10% (depending on your state of residence).

And BHG charges a modest origination fee between 3% and 5%, depending on your financial profile. Loan funds are available in as few as 5 days, but could take over a week to process.
